I am accessible by email and text/phone whenever! The Neighborhood I live very close to Yale University (1.5 miles away) and Southern CT State University (.5 miles away) I live a block away from a Natural Food Market (Edge of the Woods) and less than a mile from a major supermarket (Stop and Shop). There is a lovely pond and park to walk to down the block. Getting Around New Haven is easily reachable by train from NYC (the train station is about a $12 taxi ride from the house). Taxi: I recommend using Uber as it's much cheaper (it's like AirBnB for taxis) or you can call ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) for a local taxi. City bus: The New Haven bus stops at Goffe and Norton about every 20-30 minutes (Z line, two houses down) or at Whalley and Norton (B line, every 10-15 minutes). Both will take you downtown, and you can ask for a transfer pass if you want to go somewhere else. Yale bus: The closest Yale bus stop is about 1 mile away, at 25 Science Park. Other Things to Note Yale University has a beautiful campus. The Yale Visitor's center is at 149 Elm St if you'd like to take a tour. Pizza New Haven is serious about pizza. The best pizza places are Modern, Pepe's, Bar, and Sally's. You definitely shouldn't miss out on trying at least one of them while you are in town! Unfortunately, they don't deliver. Hamburgers The first hamburger was invented here at Louis' Lunch. Prime 16 has fantastic burgers. Restaurants Besides pizza and hamburgers, New Haven has an amazing array of restaurants. My favorite are 116 Crown for apps/cocktails, Cash Republic for beer selection, Barcelona for tapas, Meat & Co. for sandwiches, Bella's or Lena's for brunch, Claire's Cornercopia for deserts, and Caseus for everything cheese related. + More","House Rules No smoking indoors.

A RECENT REVIEW OF THE PROPERTY: ""We had a wonderful family reunion at the Boulders Inn on Lake Waramaug, Connecticut (24 adults and 14 children.) The Inn, carriage house and cabins sleep 38 comfortably. Almost all bedrooms have their own TV and private bath. Every room has been beautifully renovated and everyone commented on the ultra comfortable beds and beautiful linens. The adults would meet in the morning for coffee in the absolutely wonderful, state of the art, newly renovated kitchen at the Boulders. For those staying in the carriage house, (7 bedrooms, many with fireplaces) it also has a great ambiance and its own fabulous kitchen. Our family loved the brand new swimming dock A boathouse provided great fun for the children. There is a ping pong table, multiple fishing rods and kayaks for those who want to explore the lake. Our children spent all day swimming and fishing off the dock. There are wonderful lounge chairs for those who just want to relax and take in the spectacular view of the lake. Family dinners cooked on the two extra large grills were highlights of our trip. Cocktails on the terrace watching sunsets over the Connecticut hills was magical. The Inn is surrounded by beautiful gardens and expansive grounds. Needless to say, we had many exciting volleyball, badminton and soccer games. Our road bikers, who went out daily for 3 hour rides, gave the whole area a superb rating. The Boulders is located in a beautiful and historic part of Connecticut. There is wonderful antiquing, shopping and good restaurants in the immediate vicinity. There was something for every age group. It was our family's first major reunion and it was a huge success. I cannot say enough about the Boulders. We loved it!""

Lake views, sandy beach, swimming, tennis court, billiards, deck, grill, Aga kitchen, and quiet forest setting. 5 minutes off route 7, 10 minutes from Danbury CT. The ""gemutlich"" ambiance of an original 30s lake house with its fieldstone walls, pine shiplap paneling, vaulted ceilings, wood-burning fireplace, and period antiques is what makes this house so charming. Flooded with natural light, with lake or lush green forest seen from every room, this is the perfect place to relax and enjoy the feeling of home. House, deck, yard, parking, lake beach (swimming, fishing), tennis courts. Weber grill on deck (except in winter) and hot tub right off the deck are yours to use--just please leave things clean upon departure. Washer and dryer in basement available to guests booking for a week or more; otherwise, basement and garage are not accessible. Other than greeting the guests and giving you brief orientation, the house is yours to enjoy. The house is in a private lake community, where 80% of the residents enjoy their lake houses in summer only, so in the off-season of September though May there is a lot of peace and tranquility! Walk across the lane (just 500 feet to the left is the community clubhouse, where you can sit on the deck, or descend the driveway or stairs down to the beach and hang out!). If the lake is frozen solid and smooth in the winter, ice skating is always possible, and if there is a blanket of snow on top, then cross-country skiing is at its finest. In the summer, swimming and lounging on the beach are your favorite pastimes, or rent a boat from Echo Bay Marina down the road and enjoy water skiing, wakeboarding, or tubing on Candlewood Lake. Things to do outside the community: ~ Farmer's Market in New Milford on Saturday mornings in the warmer months. ~ Many hikes in the area (Naromi Land Trust trails [(website hidden)], access to the Appalachian Trail + more.) ~ Pratt Nature Center, biking on Lake Waramaug, Elephant's Trunk Flea Market, Bank Street Theater, and more on Guidebook ~ Like to ski?

However, if you have friends coming from NYC, the closest train station is Danbury, CT (about 20 minutes away) but the most convenient --because it is a direct line and does not require transferring--is Brewster, NY (about 30 minutes away). A cab from either of these places will probably run $40-$50, so usually not feasible. If you are coming from an airport on CT Limo, your stop in Danbury is at the Maron Hotel, where you might catch a $35-45 cab to the house. There is plenty of shopping on Route 7 in New Milford (Walmart, Home Goods, TJ Maxx, etc.) and your best grocery stores are Stop & Shop, Big Y, and Aldi. If you want to hike, you are near the Appalachian Train entrance in Bull's Bridge and Kent, and there's great hiking at several state parks: Lover's Leap, Kent Falls, Mt. Tom, and Macedonia are the closest and most convenient. The local park is Harrybrook, and just down Candlewood Lake Road South is a small park called Dykes Point which gives you a lovely path along the lake. For Memorial Day through Columbus Day (end of May through mid-October, the house is rented by the WEEK ONLY at $2500 per week. A daily price might show up on these dates but the house is indeed only available weekly in summer. However, if you see that a summer week is NOT booked 24-48 hours in advance, feel free to inquire about specific dates within that week (two night minimum) and we will try to accommodate if possible. Important: the house is normally occupied by a cat named Mr. Magoo. He will be off-premises during your visit (unless you WANT to have a sweet cat around during your stay) but anyone with cat allergies should be warned, or bring your own Zyrtek! Some people are sensitive even no matter how well the house is cleaned... House, driveway (parking for one vehicle), deck, hot tub, yard, propane grill, etc. are all yours to enjoy. Beach access, boat slip, and tennis courts are possible with pre-approved monthly rental. Washer and dryer in basement can be made available to guests booking for a week or more (steep stairs, so preapproval is required to use them!). The basement, attic storage, and garage are off limits. Other than greeting the guests and giving you brief orientation, the house is yours to enjoy! While the house is located in a secluded, almost ""rural"" area of New Milford, it offers modern convenience in that there is plenty of shopping just a few miles away on Route 7 : Walmart, Home Goods, Hope Depot, TJ Maxx, Staples, Peach Wave, etc.).

We will consider the inclusion of a well-behaved pet (dog or cat) on a case-by-case basis; just tell us about your pet to inquire. An additional cleaning fee is required for approved pets. Because the house is occasionally occupied by pets, people with allergies to dogs or cats should take note and be warned --this house may not be appropriate for people with allergies! Always ask if a dog or cat has stayed lately if you want to avoid allergic reactions. Tenants (staying 30 days or more) need to be preapproved by Community for beach, clubhouse, and tennis court access; please ask about this caveat if such access is important to you. Guest Access House, driveway (parking for one vehicle), deck, hot tub, yard, propane grill, etc. are all yours to enjoy. Beach access, boat slip, and tennis courts are possible with pre-approved monthly rental. Washer and dryer in basement can be made available to guests booking for a week or more (steep stairs, so preapproval is required to use them!). The basement, attic storage, and garage are off limits. Interaction with Guests Other than greeting the guests and giving you brief orientation, the house is yours to enjoy! The Neighborhood While the house is located in a secluded, almost ""rural"" area of New Milford, it offers modern convenience in that there is plenty of shopping just a few miles away on Route 7 : Walmart, Home Goods, Hope Depot, TJ Maxx, Staples, Peach Wave, etc.). Your best grocery stores are Stop & Shop, Big Y, and Aldi, and you can seek out your favorite libation at Classic Liquors or Nejame package store. If you want to hike, you are near the Appalachian Trail entrance in Bull's Bridge and Kent, and there's great hiking at several state parks: Lover's Leap, Kent Falls, Mt. Tom, and Macedonia are the closest and most convenient. The local park is Harrybrook, and just down Candlewood Lake Road South is a small park called Dykes Point which gives you a lovely path along the lake. Things to do outside the community: ~ Farmer's Market in New Milford on Saturday mornings in the warmer months. ~ Many hikes in the area (Naromi Land Trust trails [(website hidden)], access to the Appalachian Trail + more.) ~ Pratt Nature Center, biking on Lake Waramaug, Hopkins Inn, Hopkins Vineyard, White Silo Vineyard, DeGrazia Vinyard, Elephant's Trunk Flea Market, Bank Street Theater, and brunch at American Pie! ~ Like to ski? The house is centrally located close to several ski slopes: * Thunder Ridge: a family oriented starter slope is about 40 minutes away across the NYS border in Patterson, NY * Woodbury Ski Area a family resort, has winter tubing and other fun activities...45 minutes from the house * Butternut in Great Barrington, MA is 1.5 hours away...a great family ski resort * Mohawk Mountain in Cornwall, CT is closest, at only 30 minutes away Getting Around The only convenient way to get to New Milford is to DRIVE--and you really will need to rely on GPS to find it. However, if you have friends coming from NYC, the closest train station is Danbury, CT (about 20 minutes away) but the most convenient --because it is a direct line and does not require transferring--is Brewster, NY (about 30 minutes away). A cab from either of these places will probably run $40-$50, so usually not feasible. If you are coming from an airport on CT Limo, your stop in Danbury is at the Maron Hotel, where you might catch a $35-45 cab to the house. Other Things to Note Holiday weekends are priced accordingly. Summer (June 20- September 7th) stays are usually by the WEEK only at $2,500 per week or $8,000 per month.

A RECENT REVIEW: ""We had a wonderful family reunion at the Boulders Inn on Lake Waramaug, Connecticut (24 adults and 14 children.) The Inn, carriage house and cabins sleep 38 comfortably. Almost all bedrooms have their own TV and private bath. Every room has been beautifully renovated and everyone commented on the ultra comfortable beds and beautiful linens. The adults would meet in the morning for coffee in the absolutely wonderful, state of the art, newly renovated kitchen at the Boulders. For those staying in the carriage house, (7 bedrooms, many with fireplaces) it also has a great ambiance and its own fabulous kitchen. Our family loved the brand new swimming dock A boathouse provided great fun for the children. There is a ping pong table, multiple fishing rods and kayaks for those who want to explore the lake. Our children spent all day swimming and fishing off the dock. There are wonderful lounge chairs for those who just want to relax and take in the spectacular view of the lake. Family dinners cooked on the two extra large grills were highlights of our trip. Cocktails on the terrace watching sunsets over the Connecticut hills was magical. The Inn is surrounded by beautiful gardens and expansive grounds. Needless to say, we had many exciting volleyball, badminton and soccer games. Our road bikers, who went out daily for 3 hour rides, gave the whole area a superb rating. The Boulders is located in a beautiful and historic part of Connecticut. There is wonderful antiquing, shopping and good restaurants in the immediate vicinity. There was something for every age group. It was our family's first major reunion and it was a huge success. I cannot say enough about the Boulders. We loved it!"" Interaction with Guests The property management is available for assistance during your stay and you will find a comprehensive list of local dining (including catering options), shopping and other services such as childcare and private chef availability upon your arrival. The Neighborhood There are many quaint shops and eateries in the neighboring towns which include New Preston, Washington, Washington Depot, Kent, Litchfield and Sharon.

The creek is fed by the Long Island Sound and the rear porch faces west for incredible waterfront sunsets. Bell Island is a private community and the perfect place to relax and unwind!,"Description The Space This unique home perched on the waters edge can comfortably sleep five. Guests have two private waterfront decks overlooking a garden with firepit and seating for four. The first floor deck has two loungers and a dining table that seats six. The third floor deck has two comfortable adirondeck chairs looking out over the water and enjoys views of the abundant wildlife of Farm Creek, a protected preserve. The view from the third floor is exceptional and our favorite place on the property. It's the perfect spot to enjoy a morning coffee, evening cocktail, or sit with a laptop or tablet to work or hop on the internet. There is cable television in the living room and each bedroom and also air conditioning and wifi throughout the grounds. We usually see about two tide changes per day and at high tide you can launch one of our two kayaks or a paddle board right off the back deck. We live here year round but we feel like we are constantly on vacation : ) Another notable aspect of the property is a private courtyard between the house and the garage. The entire property is fenced in at the front of the house too, so it's set up to allow your dog to roam freely without worrying they will get into the street. The first floor is an open format and very family friendly as you can always have your eyes on your little ones. The kitchen was updated with brand new appliances only two years ago and is perfect for the home chef. From the kitchen island you can look out onto Farm Creek and enjoy the water view at high tide or sunset in the evening. What we find most appealing about the property is the location. We are a short 1-2 minute walk from two beautiful private beaches on the Long Island Sound. Our favorite is East Beach, which looks out over a mooring field and onto nearby Tavern Island and Sheffield Island. Both islands are navigable by kayak or paddle board if you are willing to expend some effort and get a good workout in! Another great aspect of the location is a large private park a couple hundred yards from our front door. The park has a backstop and some benches along the water and is a perfect place to take your kids or your morning coffee...or espresso from our Nespresso esspresso maker! Then there is Rocky Point, a truly magnificent private park about a five minute walk from our front door. The park juts out into the sound and on a clear day you will enjoy exceptional views of Long Island and the NYC skyline about 35 miles away. As for the general accommodations, the master bedroom on the 2nd floor has a queen bed for two. The space can accommodate a crib at the foot of the bed but a crib would also fit in the master bathroom which is quite large, about 12ft x 8ft, and only steps from the bed. The third floor has another queen bed and a single bed and there is an aero mattress in the closet should you need it. We've also had guests sleep on our couch in the living room, which is deep enough one might refer to it as more of a daybed than a couch. So all in, the house can comfortably accommodate five people; two in the master queen, two in the 3rd floor queen, and then one more in the 3rd floor single bed.

The Neighborhood Knowles Landing: This quiet River oasis was once a destination for vacationers to get out of the City back during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Many would travel by steamboat to the Landing where there was a steamboat house for tickets and baggage (the steamboat house burned down before the property was purchased, but the foundation still remains in front of the dock). Shipbuilding History: Situated atop a commanding hill, this landmark Victorian was built in 1886 by the daughter and son-in-law of local steamboat Captain Edward W. Simpson. Middle Haddam was home to more than a dozen sea captains  some credited with capturing British ships off Long Island during the Revolutionary War. Trade to the West Indies is documented as far back as the 1770s. The local taverns, shops and inns, which were later converted to lovely homes and a local library, enjoyed financial success until the early 1930s when steamboat service died out along the Connecticut River. The Connecticut River: The Connecticut River has been named one of the Last Great Places"" by the Nature Conservancy. One of the most beautiful rivers in the world, it has no industrialization along its shores and its waters are rated clean enough for anything but drinking.

The area has certainly developed since my German barber and hairdresser great grandparents bought this house over 60 years ago!

The home, a stone built 'cottage' built at the turn of the century, is four bedrooms/three bathrooms and sits a hundred yards from our cabana and doc on scenic Lake Waramaug. THE UPSTAIRS * Master bedroom with a four post bed, private balcony to admire the perfect view of the lake, private sink, and a shared bathroom with... * Second large bedroom with stunning views of the lake, private sink and currently two brass single beds (although there has been discussion to upgrade it to two full size beds). THE DOWNSTAIRS: * renovated kitchen with back door entrance (leads to car parking area and garage) and breakfast bar. It's open plan with... * Large living room/dining area that includes a large flat screen TV, dvd player, stereo and collection of dvd's. * The front closed in porch (my favorite area!). There is a table that sits 6-8 where we usually eat and a sitting area to admire the views. * The den/library - a smaller room off of the living room with windows to the porch. There is a large indoor/outdoor couch that we often use for the extra guests * The back bedrooms/bathrooms: *** There are two cosy back bedrooms that we call MaWink and Gaga's rooms after my great grandmother and my great aunt. Always the host, MaWink never slept in the big bedroom upstairs, but instead kept that for her constant flow of guests coming to the house! MaWink's room is en suite with a brand, spankin' new bathroom with shower. There is an additional bathroom with full bath in the hallway for Gaga's room ;) THE CABANA: With one of the few cleared views of the lake from the street we always have bikers and walkers stop to take a picture... but don't worry, the cabana is set below on the lake so you'll barely notice them! A two room cabana with gas grill, fridge, prepping space and sitting area. Two wood docs - one attached to the cement based area and one that we float to swim out to!

With rolling hills, adorable villages, hikes, rivers, lakes, antiquing, art, fantastic restaurants... its a dream getaway only 1.5 hours from NYC. At the foot of the lake is New Preston, a small village filled with quaint antique shops, a couple lovely restaurants and a nice cafe/bakery. Kent town center is a ten minute drive and famous for its adorable high street and art scene. If you want to hang out with the townies (from the billionaires to the gas station attendant) head to GW's in Washington depot for great food, live music and plenty to drink. If you don't want to drive anywhere, take a five minute walk up the road to Hopkins Inn, restaurant and vinyard for some wine tasting and traditional Austrian cuisine. As a family we feel so lucky to have this home and while my mother now owns it (and will retire there and move from NJ) my grandparents, aunts and uncles all put their love, time and energy into the place so you might run into one of them as they mow the lawn or trim the hedges!

The house has rustic charm in its structure that is balanced by the worldly elegance of its furnishings. It is set off from the main house for partial privacy - we do share a driveway, but I am respectful of your privacy. The fully furnished top of the line gourmet kitchen has been recently built and offers custom cabinetry, Miele and Sub Zero appliances as well as most kitchen tools imaginable. There is an expansive food pantry replete with most any staple you may need to enjoy cooking during your stay. I just ask that if you use something other than flour/sugar/spices, that you replace it. The dining area seats up to six with the built in table extender (larger table cloths are in the chest next to the door along with napkins and serving bowls). Outdoors there is cushioned seating and a low table along with a gas grill and a propane fueled heater for cooler nights. I have a charcoal grill and a smoker I'd be happy to share too if you are so inclined... The living room is perfect for entertaining a large group or family with multiple seating options, a wood burning stove and TV equipped with Netflix streaming video, a DVD player, and cable. There are IPhone speaker docks in the kitchen as well as connected to the surround sound system in the living room. The furnishings are largely a combination of Grange Furniture (available through decorators only) and internationally sourced art and antiques from the owner's own collection. The lower bedroom offers two twin beds and a full bath with either Ralph Lauren or Nancy Koltes linens. There are extra pillows/linens in the armoire. The second level of this house is an extraordinary master suite with palatial arched windows (from Choate Rosemary Hall) and views of an open field and barn. This room boasts a king sized bed dressed in Ralph Lauren Suite linens, a sitting area, a chaise lounge by the television, streaming video from Netflix, and a DVD player. There is a closet area with a shoe rack and rolling rack with hangers. A small but full bath completes the upstairs bedroom. We have additional sleeping options - two twin cots with feather beds as well as a queen sized raised inflatable bed (the Frontgate version of an air mattress). Lyme is an upscale country destination with gourmet restaurants, farmers markets, endless hiking trails, numerous kayaking locations as well as world class beaches, all just minutes away. Lyme is two hours from NYC or Boston on the CT Shoreline. I am happy to help with any plans you would like to make and are happy to offer eggs for breakfast, fresh from our own chickens. We have bicycles (nothing fancy but they have wheels), picnic baskets, blankets, coolers and other accessories available for a beach picnic or a night of outdoor music at one of many local venues. We are pet friendly too! Guest Access The guest house is entirely open for guest use. I have set up a fire pit in the alpaca field and am happy to set that up for you. The barns may be messy so I prefer no guests visit the animal enclosures but feel free to roam the property! Interaction with Guests I am always available to help with adventures, dining, or anything else you may need during your stay. Call or text me at any time and I will get back to you the next time I find my phone. You can drop in to my house at any time as well! You let me know how much you want to see me. I am here to help but want to give you privacy at the same time. If you want me to check in with you, I will. If you prefer to be left completely alone, I am fine with that too. The only thing I need to do is check on animals and that involves walking toward the Guest House to get to the barns and using the hose in the back yard to fill the waterers. I do not to do this when guests are enjoying the outdoor deck but please just let me know if you prefer more privacy! The Neighborhood We are a rural residential neighborhood with the best coffee shop in New England a short walk down the road. This is a popular walking route - the triangle formed by the two roads on either side of the property and the connecting road is a 1.4 mile walk and you will likely see walkers out and about, especially on weekends, undoubtedly heading to the coffee shop. Getting Around There is public transportation in Old Saybrook (Metro North and Shoreline East trains). There is a cab service available out of Old Saybrook too. Car rentals are also in Old Saybrook. Public transportation locally is pretty much non-existent and you will need a car. The beaches are too far for me to bike but if you are a seasoned triathlete and a glutton for punishment on a basic three speed, then perhaps that is an option for you. The entire area along the shoreline (but particularly Lyme) is a very popular area for cycling. Large groups go up and down Bill HIll on weekends on a regular basis so if you are so inclined, bring your bike and experience the hills of lyme! Other Things to Note The house was an old barn. It is rustic. This is a farm. The furnishings are high end, eclectic and international. This would not, however, be a good choice for those with a minimalist aesthetic or need for a sterile environment. just saying. If there is anything less than a 5-star rating, please let me know so I can fix it for you and/or for future guests! + More","House Rules Here is the most unpleasant: I hate to say this but I have had things go ""missing."" Any decorative objects, personal effects, artwork, etc should remain in the house. I'd also appreciate your making sure all game pieces make it back into the boxes so future guest can enjoy the same activities. Now on to the more mundane: No smoking indoors and please let me know if I can provide an ashtray for outdoor use. Please pick up after your pet(s) and inform me immediately of an accident. Pots and pans are all calphalon or copper and do not go in the dishwasher. There are butcher block boards for cutting so please don't use the countertops. If you don't remember where something belongs, leave it out (my cleaners don't remember where things go on the shelves either...) and I will put it away for the next visitors. Please do not put anything away if it is not in the same condition in which you found it (yes, someone put a waffle maker on the shelf without cleaning it... Luckily I found it first!) Not to mention the coffee put in the water reservoir... If you do not know how to use one of the appliances, ask and I will tell you! If you break something, let me know. Or if someone else broke something and didn't let me know, please let me know! If you leave the house, please remember to turn off the lights and televisions. Please turn off the outside lights at night. The switch is in the downstairs hallway. The property is old and so is the septic... so please don't tax it with excessive water flow. Also, if everyone in your group wants a hot shower, the first ones in shouldn't stay too long. Nothing other than toilet paper should be flushed down the toilet. Feel free to feed the chickens! They eat leftovers of most every kind. I have a plastic compost bucket in the kitchen (above the stove) for those who are interested/willing to compost kitchen scraps. The alpaca are friendly but fearful; please let them approach you if you want to pet them. They really do not like to be chased. Especially by dogs. Dogs must remain on leash - they are unfortunately the biggest danger to both chickens and alpaca. The chickens do range freely and occasionally leave behind a mess... I hose off the deck daily but am happy to do so upon request as well! Enjoy playing in the alpaca field or reading the Sunday Times in the adirondack chairs in the orchard field - the NY Times is available upon request on Sunday mornings. We have several lawn games available - bocce, croquet, and many others. Ask and I will share. If ANYTHING is not clean/working/up to your expectations, please let me know so I can fix the situation!

Newly built in 2012, it has 3 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, woodburning fireplace, modern art & beautiful furnishings. Near Hotchkiss, Tanglewood, hiking & more.","Description The Space We built our beautiful dream house--and then I got a job in California! Barnlike on the outside, inside our place is sleek and modern and built for a relaxed, elegant, grownup life. We like to cook and eat with friends, tramp through the woods to the dock and dive into our pond, watch the sunrise through the trees, sit outside under the stars at night, and curl up with a good book in the afternoon in one of our two hammocks. Two queen beds, one double, and a convertible single in the office, plus 3.5 baths mean there's plenty of room and privacy. Front porch gets sun in the morning, back patio in the afternoon, and the dock and utterly private pond are beautiful in every season. Guest Access Guests have access to the entire house, the front porches and outdoor patio, and the private trail to our pristine dock and swimming pond. Interaction with Guests We live in California so leave keys in a lockbox on the side of the house. Our housekeeper will be available for any questions. The Neighborhood Salisbury is a beautiful colonial town with one main street, a well-stocked grocery (LaBonne's), several very good restaurants (The White Hart in Salisbury, The Woodland in Lakeville, Serevan in Amenia, No. 9 in Millerton), a beautiful historic library, and numerous outdoor attractions, from the Town Grove (swimming in summer) to hiking on the Appalachian Trail (trailheads just down the road). In Sharon (15 minutes), several farms host pick-your-own apple weekends, and Lime Rock racetrack has frequent events including antique car shows. Great Barrington (shopping, concerts, movies) is 25 minutes, Millerton about 15 (good movie theater and restaurants), Catamount ski area is 20 minutes, and Hudson's antiques and art galleries and great food are 35 minutes away. Getting Around You'll need a car, though guests could take a train from Grand Central to Wassaic (35 minutes away). Other Things to Note Some history: The 23 acre property was the site of a Revolutionary War-era iron mine (which is why we have a deep pond in the woods). You'll note cylindrical holes just off the path that were used to make charcoal to smelt the ore. Our road is dirt but plowed in winter; our next door neighbors are lovely people and always available in an emergency. We have a whole-house generator, which means you don't have to worry about losing power in a storm. We have good wi-fi, plus Blu-Ray with Netflix and Amazon Prime access. + More","House Rules Leave outside shoes in the mudroom as our floors are light oak and the rugs rather precious. No pets, sorry. No smoking in the house, and use caution if smoking outside. Please treat the house and its contents as you would your own. (This was not built as a rental house with cast-off stuff that we don't care about; this is our real house!) Swim in the pond at your own risk and be wary on the dock, which tends to be slippery when wet. (The water in the pond is very clean, but it's deep and cold!) Stay on the trails and no fires in the woods. All refuse goes to the transfer station; our house cleaner will handle that. Be sure to follow the lock-up instructions and make sure the heat is turned DOWN, not off -- and that the fire is completely extinguished.

A master bedroom with Queen sized bed and loft bedroom with three twin beds are on the second floor along with a convertible sofa on the large landing. This makes sleeping for six on the 2nd floor. On the first floor, a double bedroom and a library with pull out sofa provides private sleeping accommodations for 4 more people. Playtime in the basement with pool and air hockey.

The kitchen is the focal point of the studio. It boasts unique hand-crafted cabinetry, granite countertops, accent lighting, and top of the line appliances. The large dining table was hewn from local timber. This is not a Bed & Breakfast, and thus there is no predetermined meal schedule to adhere to.

Newly built lg barn on my N Stamford, Wooded Farm. Gated property w/ peacocks, lambs, and more. Peaceful, lovely and very private. 2 story, Open plan. 1.5 bths, sm. kitchenette, sep entrnce, htd floors, ctrl air, sleeps 4+, Nice!","Description The Space Winter Pricing in effect!! This barn is 100 years old and was moved from PA and rebuilt here as a guest space and music studio. It (and the house that is next to it) sits on family property that my grandfather bought as his country place in the 30's. In the early 50's he rented the studio cottage on the property (which currently has tenants,) to JD Salinger as a writing/living space. It is a rambling, natural 6 acres with original stone walls, that backs up to the Mianus preserve (for hiking, bird watching, and there is some fishing nearby...just ask!) I have a farm on the property and I sell fresh eggs at a roadside stand. I keep all kinds of chickens, peacocks, guinea hens, turkeys, a pig, friendly Icelandic Sheep, and rescue dogs. The Barn has its own entrance, and is very private. It has some musical equipment available because my son is a musician, (currently at music college;) so there are amps and a small drum set, congas and a couple of guitars there. Feel free to use them if you are a musician or feel the inspiration, (just not in the middle of the night!) This place is magical and beautiful; it is inspiring. The house and barn/coops are built out of 100 year old barn wood with adobe finishing in the house and barn; many of the fixtures are vintage ones that I had refurbished. The barn doors come from an antique house in North Stamford....everything has been carefully sourced and/or handed down through my family. Come and enjoy this beautiful space. It is excellent for writers and artists, musicians, or even travelers or travelling business people. I would not bring small children under 5, (it depends on your kids, but probably will be difficult with toddlers.) Note that there are roosters, guineas and peacocks, which can be loud from time to time during the day...the turkey gobbles and the lambs baaaa, but usually not at night... so it is peaceful but it is not silent;-) Guest Access Guests can walk around the farm and enjoy the animals as much as they want. They can hike on the land or walk on the streets in this walkable neighborhood (when the weather is good.) Guests can sit on the porch if they want...Please smoke outside!! Interaction with Guests I will meet with and show the guests around and will be available to answer any questions, but the beauty of this place is the privacy and peacefulness. I am around the property but am usually pretty busy. The Neighborhood Stamford is a very mixed bag. There is a real city downtown with large corporations and the young workers that come with that, night life and fine dining. We have a mall and some great shopping and a few outlets.... and then north of the parkway it is fully wooded and like a different world. I love it up here; I have been coming here for my whole life and living here full time for 20 years. Up the road is a gourmet deli and there are many full delivery restaurants. There is also a nice tavern in an antique building, right up Erskine Rd. We have access to NYC (50 mins by car or train) and all the best that country living offers. There are even some ski resorts not too far away. The shopping is great at Lord and Taylor (the best sales!) and there is a mall downtown that is nice. We also have Target and all the usual chains around here. The museums are fantastic and we are close to Caramoor with its offerings and high teas. A nature center with an antique zoo is not far, and the Katonah Museum always has something great going on. There are also some great estate sales on the weekends, antique centers downtown and a lively auction community. Ask me if you want to know if there are any when you are here. This is an excellent place for a getaway, or meeting, or for business travel; It is also a great place to come and paint or write....or just kick back and read our extensive collection of books. Getting Around there are buses that run hourly down long ridge rd. and there are metro north trains to NYC. Parking at the station is cheap for an entire day and its as easy to take the train as it is to drive in and leave your car in a lot. I often get a groupon for parking in the city and go down for the day by car. Metro North, New York City, I-95, Merritt Parkway, I-684, Broadway, NY, Manhattan.

Please ask me about anything, and if you would like to have a meeting or house some of your travelling clients here, it is ideal.

The house originally sat near the Boston Post Road but was moved back to its present position and lovingly renovated by the Hodgdson family at the turn of the last century. At that time, the sunken garden, the porches and back portion of the house were added. In the 1930's, Henrietta Greenleaf Lindsay, a widow with a large house to maintain, followed the advice of her actress friend, Elsie Ferguson, and opened the Bee and Thistle Inn to the public.

The house is ideal for families or couples traveling together. Guests have access to a galley kitchen, dining room, living room, laundry in basement, and back garden patio area.

Three comfortable bedrooms, plus a fold-out. All the amenities for a perfect country getaway!","Description The Space We call our wonderful vacation home, 'Serenity', because all your stress and worries will disappear when you're here! This beautifully renovated, 120 year-old former mill sits just feet away from a lovely brook on a 7-acre, heavily wooded lot just off of Route 4 in Litchfield county, CT. In the summer, open the windows and you can hear the water flowing by from every room in the house. You'll love falling asleep to the sound! There's lots of room to explore on the property. Splash around in the brook, watch for trout, or just sit and gaze at the waterfall. We're very close to the Audubon preserve, so you never know what rare birds you might see (there's a Blue Heron that loves to stalk the brook trout right next to the house). Like looking at nature but don't want to be out in it? You'll love the screened in Arizona Room with large sliding glass doors on three sides. Feel like relaxing with a good movie? You'll enjoy the flat-screen TV and 24 hr. On-Demand movies through Comcast. Classic movie buffs will enjoy our Alfred Hitchcock movie library. Alfred Hitchcock was a good friend of a previous owner and often vacationed at the house! Of course, you'll never find a better spot for curling up with a good book. Check out all the dining, shopping, and other activities available in beautiful Litchfield County, then come home and relax with a bubble bath in the huge clawfoot tub. There's a fully-stocked kitchen with everything you need for whipping up a great meal and a nice big gas grill for those summer cookouts. In the winter months, you'll love being surrounded by a wintry wonderland as you are warmed by the cozy fireplace. Winter sports fans will enjoy the nearby Mohawk Ski Resort. We know once you've experienced 'Serenity', you'll never want to leave! Guest Access The main house and surrounding yard and brook will be yours for the duration of your stay. The driveway and garage, separated by a stone path from the main house, is shared by our main house guests and our caretaker apartment tenants (the apartment is on the opposite side of the garage from the main house, and cannot be seen from the house and yard areas). Interaction with Guests We manage the rental of ""Serenity"" remotely, so our interaction will only be through email and phone. You are unlikely to come into contact with our apartment tenants excepts possibly when taking out your car. They do not use the main house areas, and they know our guests come here for privacy and peace and quiet. The Neighborhood Litchfield County is one of the most beautiful areas I've been to, which is, of course, one of the reasons we bought ""Serenity""! It is the perfect mix of peaceful countryside living, with the benefits of great restaurants, historic sites, culture, shops/galleries, wineries, and plenty of festivals and activities throughout the year. Our place is located on a designated Scenic Drive, and whether you're in town for the fall colors, summer festivals, or snow season, it's just gorgeous! Getting Around It's the middle of the country, no buses, ha! We're about an hour and a half drive from the Hartford airport, and 15 or 20 minutes from the Amenia trainstation, which is about an hour & 45 minute train ride from Grand Central. At ""Serenity"", you will have access to one garage space, and two driveway parking spaces. Other Things to Note We have a two night minimum normally, three night minimum during Holiday weekends and the peak summer season. The $200/night rate is for 1-2 adults using only the Master bedroom. Additional bedrooms used are an extra $20 flat fee for each room used (this helps offset the extra cleaning costs for groups while keeping the rate lower for couples). ***Please note: AirBnB options only allow us to list the $20 fee as ""Per Person/per night"", but in fact it's only per extra BED used. If your ""automatic"" total comes up too high, we will send you a Special Offer price once you've sent an inquiry.) The rental rate is higher during our peak summer months as well as Holiday weekends. Peak rates: $250/night, $1250/week, $4000/month. We generally require month-or-longer rentals during June-August, but will open any unsold dates up to shorter stays around May. The refundable security deposit is $100 for weekend and weekly stays, and $500 for month-long rentals. ***Please note: we are new to AirBnB, but have been renting out ""Serenity"" for several years now to many lovely, satisfied guests through other vacation rental by owner websites. Unfortunately, AirBnB blocks us from posting links to other websites here, but we'd be happy to send you info on previous reviews if requested. + More","House Rules Because the house is on a well and septic system, we do have a strict eight person maximum occupancy, and the number of overnight guests must be stated in our rental agreement.

Rebuilt in 1915 as a family farmhouse with adjacent farrier's shed. Rebuilt again in the 1990s as a weekend home.,"Description The Space Breezy and light-filled. Close to great restaurants, Mohawk Mountain skiing, Indian Mountain and Hotchkiss Schools, Lime Rock Park, recreational trails, the Village of Millerton, and farmers' markets. Built as a country Gothic-revival church in 1885 on the edge of farmland in Sharon Valley by the Parish of Saint Bernard's. Rebuilt in 1915 as a family farmhouse with adjacent farrier's shed. Rebuilt again in the 1990s. Engineered to accommodate 180 people on Sundays, the first floor's oak joists are 2x10 inches and 12 inches on center. The home unbuttons in the late spring and remains airy and cool all summer. Westerly winds from upstate New York glance off Indian Mountain and head south down Sharon Valley, making the neighborhood ten degrees cooler year-round than Brooklyn's Park Slope, where the owners live and work during the week. By mid-autumn the home buttons up for a snug, warm winter. Careful use of building materials containing no volatile organic compounds makes the home a delight for anyone sensitive to allergens and irritants. Sharon Valley is lush with water, its drainage established at the end of the last Ice Age, and our land is home to the tallest tri-leader birch in Litchfield County, nearly 85 years old. We furnish the house with cotton sheets, cotton and wool blankets, and feather comforters and pillows. There's a hair dryer under the sink in the en-suite bathroom, and a steam iron and ironing board for do-it-yourselfers, but we very much like New England Dry Cleaners in Millerton on US Route 44 near the Connecticut state line. Guest Access Everything except, perhaps, our too-cluttered red barn and the attic loft space. Feel free to use all appliances, including the dishwasher, clothes washer, dryer, clothesline, clothes racks, hair dryer, steam iron and ironing board, refrigerator, freezer, and propane oven and range (similar to natural gas). We mostly brew with a Cuisinart coffee maker, and we love our old Revere Ware pots and pans. There's always ground coffee, and help yourself to anything you see in the pantries and cupboards. There are a couple of Apple chargers on a table in the mudroom off the driveway, one of which converts to micro-USB for use with Android phones. Interaction with Guests Sometimes on arrival and on weekends. The owners are often working in the City when they'd rather play in the Country. The Neighborhood Nearby restaurants are Monte's and Serevan in Amenia, the Oakhurst Diner, Manna Dew, and No. 9 in Millerton, the Boathouse and Woodland in Lakeville, and Pastorale and the White Hart Inn in Salisbury. Nearby hiking and nature observation on the Harlem Valley Rail Trail, South Taconic Trail, and Appalachian Trail. Sharon Valley was, we can report, once a world center for the manufacture of mousetraps, but that hasn't been true for a hundred years. Note the ancient tri-leader birch in the photograph from the rear yard, looking north: it is the tallest in Litchfield County and nearly 85 years old. The most remarkable views are from the South Taconic Trail near the boundary where Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut all meet. (North of the Village of Millerton, take Dutchess County Route 63 (the road to Boston Corner) to Deer Run Road, and park along Quarry Hill Road at a trail head.) The South Taconic Trail has some segments best climbed with both feet and hands. The much gentler, nearly level Harlem Valley Rail Trail is a particular favorite and a stroll in the country, illustrating the differences among fens, marshes, and bogs. Sharon Valley is a part of the Taconic Range and Litchfield Hills, small segments of the Appalachian Mountains. Getting Around If you have a car, park in the gravel driveway. Or use Dutchess Taxi Man or your bicycles to ride over from Wassaic train station: 13 minutes by car, or 48 minutes by bicycle on the rail trail via the old Sharon (Train) Station. The walk from the train station on foot via the Harlem Valley Rail Trail is 155 minutes. (Though we carried no backpacks, we recommend comfortable boots for all hikes.) Dutchess County long-ago stopped running buses between Amenia and Millerton. In Sharon, Doug Hobby's Autosport at ((PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) has an auto rental service that picks up people at the Wassaic Station on weekdays, and allows for drop-offs on Sunday. Other Things to Note 100 miles north of New York City. Two hours by train from Grand Central Terminal to the end of the Harlem Valley Line at Wassaic Station. Thirteen minutes by car from Wassaic Station. One mile from the New York State line at Amenia and Millerton. Ten minutes by car to the Village of Millerton. Eleven minutes by car to the Hotchkiss School. Nearly three minutes by car to Sharon Hospital. + More","House Rules Visitors might be quiet and polite, similar to the neighbors. The neighbors all have grandchildren who visit and play in their yards, so bring your kids with you. Please moderate any amplified music by 9:00 PM: our neighbors turn in early. Yes, children may ring the ship's bell during daylight hours. Please, no pets. We are allergic to most pet danders, and gave up smoking a few years ago, so we ask visitors to smoke outside. (While the house smells fresh, the owners still associate alcohol and tobacco with fun.) When present the owners will serve cocktails at five o'clock. Please take out all garbage and compost before leaving. Please use the garbage pails next to the red barn at the top of the gravel driveway. (There are clear plastic bags underneath the easternmost kitchen counter.) Visitors may optionally sort for recycling (glass, plastics, metals, and papers) and for composting. If composting, there's a brown copper compost pail on the kitchen countertop that accepts *all* food scraps -- greens and proteins, including animal bones, fats, and gristle. The south side of the red barn has a Jora composter from Denmark to cook the food scraps. Spinning the composter will bring up a hatch door with a latch, where you can empty the pail. The Danes know how to make composters that cook in cold weather, and we are huge fans of Bud Trillin's essay ""Letters to the Solid Waste Commissioner"" and his command to 'see page 347 of Volume 3 of ""A Simple Guide to Recycling"" (third edition)'. If we're not here when you leave, please strip the beds and place all the linens and towels in the laundry room on the first floor. (Connie launders all the linens and blankets within 48 hours.) In the summertime, please close all windows to within a few inches to keep out rain. Please turn off all lights and appliances. Please re-lock the door from the kitchen into the rear yard. Please leave the house key on a table in the mudroom where you first entered, pulling the door closed and locked behind you. Don't worry if you forget anything: we like our postal clerks and enjoy having an excuse to visit them at the post office the next weekend. Oh, and don't hesitate to call with any questions: Walter's cel (phone number hidden) and Brooklyn landline (phone number hidden).

The neighbors are all friendly and I assure that although one end of the street does not look like the other, there are no safety concerns whatsoever. The Port Jefferson ferry is nearby for those traveling from LI. Getting Around There are public buses but these are a bit tough to navigate. You can park in the driveway or on the street and drive anywhere. You can also walk in to SoNo or along the harbor and circle around to the park on the far side. Weekenders from the city: it has both Metro North and I-95 nearby. The Port Jefferson Ferry makes eastern Long Island access easy.

The neighborhood is safe and convenient to town, and the best beaches in the world are 15 minutes away. The house fits 6 people like so: 2 in kingsize bed/master suite; 1 (or 2) on full mattress upstairs in adjoining room, 2 in twin beds downstairs, 1 in smaller guest bedroom. (pics will be updated by May 1--the pink bedroom will have 2 beds, the smaller ""wooden headboard"" bedroom will have one.) Ceiling fans , new windows, comfortable seating. Gas fireplace heats large living space downstairs. Cute little garden outside to relax in or barbecue. You can see the river from the upstairs master bedroom with skylight. Plenty of room, plenty of privacy. Some have noted that the house is on a well-traveled street, with a neighborhood restaurant bar-restaurant half a block away. This is a plus for some, since great bars and restaurants are walking distance. Neighbors look out for one another here, but of course, lock your car and the house doors. Also, the Amtrack train runs just across the street on a raised track at regular hours (about 4 times a day and night). One more thing in the spirit of full disclosure: there are hourly church bells. Some like it, some don't: ear plugs provided to every guest ;) Guest Access When guests are staying, my 21 year old daughter Emma and I move out. She or I may be staying in the adjoining studio. You will have the house to yourselves. House used to be 2-family, renovated to one (not a duplex), and there is plenty of room and privacy-door and stairway between main part of the house and master suite, which is a large space w kingsize canopied bed and 5' double shower in bathroom.

Farmers markets nearby; vineyards in Stonington 10 minutes away. Providence 45 minutes north; Narragansett half hour. Area is chock full of fitness/yoga studios, some walking distance-in town. Because the town is so close by , the place becomes a wonderful retreat and escape--privacy and solitude if you like, or just a walk down the block to sit at neighborhood pubs (CC OBrian's, Perks & Corks, Twisted Vine, etc ) I did have one guest out of 20 mention that the church bells and train sounds were a bit bothersome, but at least one other thought they were charming additions and he never needed to check his watch!

The house is on a beautiful scenic road, 5 minutes from Lake Waramaug State Park with it's lovely beach, canoe & kayak rentals and a boat launch. The house has its original central hearth and wideplank floors, is simply decorated and very comfortable. There is a large dining room and a sunny eat-in kitchen, but in the summer the screened-in porch with its view of the hayfields is the place to be. The owner lives at the far end of the driveway in a converted tobacco barn. The houses are separated by a wide lawn, perfect for barbecues, badminton, picnics, croquet or just rolling around. Guest Access Guests are free to enjoy the restored English perennial garden, catch frogs in the pond, wander along the brook in the back woods or pick berries at the pick-your-own organic blueberry operation that is up and running on the back acres July-Sept. Guests are also welcome to use a portion of the vegetable garden for their own planting. Interaction with Guests I am usually around all summer and can answer any questions and offer suggestions. But it is a big property and you can have as much privacy as you want. The Neighborhood This part of Litchfield County is a vacationer's paradise.

A very small WC, a kitchen, and a parlor make up the first floor.","Description The Space Clover Nook, named by the builder, is set next to a ravine. The millstream, Pameacha Creek, becomes a torrent in the spring. This two-family house has a door between the kitchens, which is often open during the summer.The larger bedroom, with a king bed, faces the rising sun. The small bedroom is suitable for two kids; it's on the driveway, which we share with the house next door. If a family needed more room, we could discuss putting an airbed in the parlor. I work at home, so I need access to my office, but I promise to stay out of your way. Guest Access The house has wireless Internet. I don't have much in the way of TV (very basic cable), but I do have Netflix. There is only one TV, which is in the parlor. When the weather is good, guests are welcome to use the garden and the back area. I hesitate to call it a patio because it is where I pot plants, but it is where we grill and build fires. We have a battered fire pit and plenty of wood. If you are traveling with small children, I would be happy to lay in some basic supplies for you. Interaction with Guests During your visit, I will be in my office during the day and in the apartment next door at night if any questions or problems come up. The Neighborhood This is an ethnically and culturally mixed neighborhood, and it is mixed zoning. Clover Nook once housed a beauty parlor; we found two of those old-fashioned hair dryers with the huge hoods in the basement. Toward the end of the street stands a collection of very small houses that were probably built to house mill employees. At the very end is the house where the songwriter Henry Clay Work was born. Among his best-known tunes are ""Marching Through Georgia"" and ""My Grandfather's Clock."" There is a statue of Work on Middletown's South Green, which is a few blocks from the house. Getting Around Middletown does have a bus system, and I have a schedule, but most people drive, walk, or bike. Parking is available in the driveway or on the street. Other Things to Note When a guest arrived recently, she asked if we could recommend a good massage therapist. We said sure--ours. Lugging her table, Joan made a house call. Everyone was pleased, and Joan decided she would be happy to do it again. If anyone who books at Clover Nook would like to arrange for a massage, I will pass along Joan's number after the booking, and Joan and the guest can make whatever arrangement they like. We have an ancient cat who has the run of the house; however, she hasn't been in either bedroom for years. + More","House Rules No smoking is allowed in the house.

Many noteworthy people have made it their second (home away from) home. Our masterfully restored and enhanced 1779 Colonial property is on the Connecticut State Register of Historic Places, and is rich with history yet modern comforts, offering you a sophisticated, private country experience on 7 acres, replete with horses. Our 15 baby chicks arrived in early May, and guests can now help themselves to fresh eggs laid by organically-fed, free-range chickens. This two-story cottage includes a cobblestone (propane-fueled) fireplace, and a gourmet kitchen fully appointed and stocked so that you can cook and eat in if you so choose. Awaken to a selection of coffees, teas, hot cocoa and/or hot cider. And while nearby Marty's Cafe in charming Washington Depot is a favorite for our guests who like to slip out for a cappuccino or latte early in the AM, we have just added a Jura Capresso F9 semi-automatic espresso machine, complete with fresh-roasted ""Inspiration"" beans from a local coffee roaster so that you can stay in and make your own. And, for foodies that crave a ""farm to table experience""--we can provide you with lots of suggestions re: where to find local, sustainably and in many cases organically grown produce, poultry and beef. If you choose to eat out over cooking in, we are near an eclectic selection of restaurants, ranging from a Southern Barbecue to a British pub, and one that features organic/sustainable fare that you won't have to procure or prepare yourselves. And for those that love live music, we are just one-half hour away from the Infinity Music Hall. And the highly acclaimed Warner Theater in Torrington CT (also just one half-hour away) has a great variety of both shows and performers. We are near fabulous antique shopping, numerous artist's studios, independent bookstores and boutique shops, and several highly renowned spas (The Mayflower and the Winvian). In the alternative, for those that like to be pampered--we can arrange for you to have a Shiatsu massage right here in the privacy of the cottage. And for those that love the outdoors, walking, running and cycling trails abound! Kent State Park, White Memorial and Steeprock Preserve are all less than 20 minutes away. And of course, there are several fantastic, scenic and challenging golf courses nearby. (Want to train out of New York with just a backpack and your bikes? We'll pick you up and drop you off at the Metro North station at Harlem Valley/Wingdale--just 20 minutes away). For skiers, Mohawk Mountain is less than 20 minutes away. They literally invented snowmaking, so as long as it's cold enough out during the evening hours (11P-7A) for them to have their snow guns operating (which cover 100% of the mountain), they'll be white and deep enough for you to ski to your heart's content. Guests who like to challenge themselves by visiting different ski areas over the course of their stay can also venture East to Ski Sundown (which is 40 minutes away) or North into the Berkshires, and traverse the trails of Berkshire East, Butternut and/or Catamount ski areas--all less than 90 minutes away. Regardless, we are confident that you will enjoy your recreational time skiing in the area, and your aprs-ski time relaxing by our (thermostatically-controlled) fireplace, or by taking a rejuvenating steam shower in our (heated) marble-floored bath. During the Summer, with advance notice (your car's registration info and an $80.00 fee payable to the Town of Warren), you can have access to a private, beautiful and secluded town beach located just 5 miles away on one of the cleanest lakes in New England. Do you have a child attending a private school in Litchfield County? We are proximate to many area schools, including Canterbury, Kent School, South Kent School, Hotchkiss, Rumsey Hall and the Taft School. Guest Access Our guests are free to roam the property, feed the horses, gather eggs from the chicken coop, swing on our tree swing and even pounce on our trampoline. Interaction with Guests We normally greet our guests at check-in time, offering a brief tour and whatever area suggestions they may like. From that point forward, they are entitled to the privacy our property (and County!) offers. That said, we are a fun-loving, gregarious family (especially Jax, our dog) and just love getting to know our guests that would like to get to be known!

From the solar panels outside to the life-affirming wood interior, this apartment exudes positive energy. Relax and enjoy the architecturally unique features.","Description The Space Amazing views of the Quiet Corner of Connecticut await you. Come enjoy this retreat, fully equipped to ""recharge your batteries"" after your days of vacationing, researching, or conducting business. Being two miles from UConn and Storrs downtown, with easy access to public transportation, this location remains convenient while helping you feel that you've gotten away from it all. We hope you will love the natural feel of the wood as much as we do in our architecturally-unique home. Guest Access The apartment is equipped with its own modern kitchen, patio and deck areas, independent of the main house. The private, upstairs bathroom is right off the main bedroom and includes a tub and shower. The futon in the living room downstairs folds out into another queen-sized bed, accommodating additional guests. The half-bath downstairs is also private to our guests. The dining area takes in views from the south and west; the upstairs seating area looks south and east. High-speed wireless internet is available throughout the apartment. Interaction with Guests The apartment is attached to the main house, so we are only a text away should you need anything. There is a bulletin board in the apartment with brochures and menus from some of our favorite places to visit. Though this area is called the Quiet Corner, having UConn so close provides us with many culinary and cultural treats. The Neighborhood Located right next to the Spring Hill Historic District, our property is surrounded by the open space of UConn fields and Joshua Trust land. Walking along Route 195 is not recommended, but hiking along the Nipmuk Trail is! Our view rivals 50-foot, which is another vista along the Nipmuk trail, a short hike east from the house. We are two miles from downtown Storrs and the UConn campus to the north and Willimantic is not much further to the south. Storrs is located en route between Boston and New York City in the Quiet Corner of Connecticut. Getting Around Bicycle riding is pretty hilly around Mansfield, but the ride to UConn is gradual. The Willimantic to Storrs bus runs regularly and stops just a short walk away from the apartment. Two parking spaces on the property are available for free during your stay. Other Things to Note The apartment is a pet-free zone. Our dogs, Keepsie and Hawk, live in the main house and don't have access to the apartment interior or patio deck area. Sustainability reigns at the EcoHaven as the 27kW solar PV system provides the energy for the high-efficiency geothermal heating and cooling units. The apartment is equipped with energy-saving Nest thermostats and LED (warm) lighting. The house is oriented south, with few windows on the north side to maximize passive solar gain and keep the New England elements at bay. We encourage you to plug in your all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle to recharge its battery as you charge your own. + More","House Rules We do not allow our guests to bring their pets with them to stay in the apartment. Smoking anywhere on the property is prohibited. We live in a residential area where families and students need their sleep.

It is conveniently located on the first floor of a private 2-unit home. The apartment is spacious and bright with ceiling fans in all rooms. The rooms have been decorated with modern, European-style furniture and artwork. Amenities include free WiFi internet access throughout the property; a washer and dryer in the basement; and a spacious, shaded garden with a sitting area and barbecue grill for outdoor cooking. It is an ideal rental for a couple, two roommates or a family with children. Pearl Street is ideally located only 2 blocks to Yale's School of Management (SOM) and campus; only 1 block to the Yale shuttle for easy transportation; and a short distance from neighborhood grocery stores, shops, restaurants, and downtown New Haven. Guest Access Private 2 bedroom apartment, backyard, off-street parking Interaction with Guests I live on the 2nd floor of the 2 family house and I am there to give suggestions for dining and area activities. The Neighborhood Welcome to New Haven, a very vibrant and beautiful city! There are many great places to live in or around New Haven, but East Rock is quite special because it is a very active and caring community and because it is within walking distance of grocery stores, restaurants, shops, a great park with hiking trails, and, of course, Yale campus and downtown. My house on Pearl Street is sandwiched between Orange Street to the east and Upper State Street to the west. Orange Street stretches from the New Haven downtown area in the south to the north with East Rock Park, a 10 mile network of hiking trails and a summit overlooking New Haven and the Long Island Sound. The weekly bike rides, organized by Elm City Cycling, are a great way to explore the area while making new friends. Although the East Rock part of Orange Street has mostly residential homes, it also has a good number of family-owned grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, and a neighborhood pharmacy and postal service. Just a block from Pearl Street is Cafe Romeo where one can sit on the outside patio to enjoy a cup of coffee and delicious home-baked muffins. Nica's Market is a wonderful grocery store and yet another favorite place for locals to meet for breakfast or lunch on the patio. Joe, the owner, always welcomes his customers with a big smile and makes sure they get the freshest produce. To the west of Pearl Street is Upper State Street, a historic district with mix of restaurants, bars, cafes, bakeries, boutiques, delicatessen, and a weekly farmers market. Just a couple of blocks away is Modern Apizza, my favorite place to order brick-oven pizza to take home. Besides Italian, you'll also find a number of other cuisines including Mexican, Chinese and Thai. Pearl Street is also part of the SoHu (South of Humphrey Street), a very active neighborhood with great residents, many of whom grew up here. The community spirit of East Rock, but in particular being part of SoHu, is what makes living here in New Haven so enjoyable and memorable.

Enjoy the plants and animals in garden and on the farm and take a hike on the adjacent Byles trail. Interaction with Guests Jasmine and I will be happy to tell you about the attractions, food, performances, and other goodies in the area. We'd love to sit and talk with you about our individual adventures or leave you to yourselves if that is what you prefer. The Neighborhood Henrietta House is located in Ashford, CT, which just celebrated its 300th anniversary. We are located in the ""Quiet Corner""/Last Green Valley of Connecticut, one we consider to be one of the most beautiful in the area. Many adventures await you here: hiking, biking, swimming, kayaking, horse-back riding among other nature loving activities. In addition, antiquing, gourmet dining, professional performances, sporting events, wine-tastings, as well as more down-home activities, such as local fairs, pick-your-own, and farmers' markets can be found within minutes of our house. One very bright spot on our event calendar is ""Walktober."" Please visit in October to take part in the many, many activities offered by the towns and villages throughout our region. Getting Around To really enjoy all that our area offers, a car is pretty necessary. However, hiking trails are adjacent to the house and biking can take you into other areas fairly close by to explore. We are on the B&B bike trail and also the Connecticut Historic Barn Trail. With advance notice and a few dollars, we might be able to pick you up from the bus, train station, or airport. Buses run from nearby Storrs to Hartford and from Hartford buses and trains are available to take you anywhere you desire. Other Things to Note We are just beginning to farm our property and have recently planted over 100 blueberry bushes, 50 strawberry plants, 4 fruit trees, and multiple herbs. We plant a big organic garden every year and will be adding more fruits and veggies this next year. We also plan to have animals so that we can grow most of the food we serve for our breakfasts and snacks.

The apartment is adjacent to a larger home with views of a 12 mile lake and stunning sunrises. We live on the lake. Stone steps lead to a private stone patio & dock. Take a kayak or the canoe out for a spin or just jump in the water on a warm day. We'll leave the paddles and life jackets inside the apartment for your use. This sunny and spacious apartment is adjacent to the main house. It is brand new with its own separate entrance and privacy. Walk out the door to 2200 acres of Paugusett State Forest with miles of hiking, trail running, birding, the foliage is sublime in the fall, snowshoeing, serenity. A bird watching haven, we have bald eagles, osprey, goshawks, swans, ducks, song birds galore... People come from all around to fish on lake Zoar. When you're on the property you are surrounded by water and forest. Looking down the lake, there are no homes in sight, they're all behind you on the approach to the driveway. You'll think you're all alone here. There is a queen size sleep sofa/pull out couch in the living room, so the apartment sleeps four. The whole house is for sale - check out William Raveis/Connie Widman. You may be asked to tidy up for an occasional showing. This is only if you've left a big mess. _: )) If you can help us out, we'll give you a $25 discount OR buy you a drink or appetizer at the Foundry. Text or call me from there during the showing.

You will be able to use the dock, kayaks, canoe exclusively when we are not up from the city and share when we are there. Interaction with Guests We will be there some but not all of the time. My neighbor will be greeting you and keeping an eye on things when we're not home. Of course, I'll be available by text and email for any questions.

When you arrive, you'll wonder where you are but once you find the gravel driveway with the stone pillar at the end, you'll understand that this is a one in a million place. Getting Around You'll need a car :)) Other Things to Note Buy your food on the way and settle in. I have set up the Guidebook so you know your way around but you'll probably never want to leave this gorgeous retreat. :)) I live on a private road so the only people who enter the forest at my end are people from the neighborhood. We have Eagles year round. If you want a better chance at spotting them, go to Shepaug Eagle Observation Station, it's right up the lake. Often, you'll see people pulled over on the side of the road on your way. Stop, pull over, look where they're looking - they've spotted an eagle. Take the back way in along the Pootatuck River.

The subsequent owner put on an addition for his mother-in-law - which became the main Guest Room when we moved in a few years ago. Guest Access The primary Guest Room is located on the main level of the house, but is separated from the living space by two doors. It has a Queen Bed with a Tempurpedic Mattress on a remotely controlled adjustable base, an A/C unit and overhead fan. The ensuite bathroom has a shower, a whirlpool tub, and a bidet. We have a second bedroom upstairs which sleeps one person. The bed in that room also has a Tempurpedic Mattress on an adjustable base. This room is best suited for a child or young adult. Should you need more space, there is an additional bedroom (with bunk beds) that we can put at your disposal - so feel free to ask. If we can accommodate you, we will. If you would like to use the Sauna or the Pool, you are welcome to do so as long as we are home. The Wood Stove will only be on if we are in the house. You can sit outside on the flagstone patio any time you wish - and on a nice night, if we are home, we can put some wood in the Chiminaea. If you have younger children, they are welcome to use the swing set. If the weather is not as cooperative as you would like, you are welcome to avail yourselves of our Netflix and Hulu+ subscriptions or watch a movie from our collection. We have several from the 1940s and 1950s. Interaction with Guests We are a homeschooling family who love meeting people and learning about different cultures. If you are inclined to share, we would love to listen. Various family members have food restrictions, so we are not in a position to allow guests to use the kitchen to cook their own food. However, we are more than happy to treat you to breakfast. If the hens are laying, we will have even fresh eggs available! If you are here while we are having lunch or dinner, and are happy to eat whatever we are having, you are welcome to share. If you have special dietary needs, chances are we've already got them covered! Celebrating a special occasion? Please do let us know. We love to come up with creative ideas for surprises. If you want total privacy we are fine with that, too. The Neighborhood There are plenty of beautiful places to visit in our general area. Feel free to ask us for recommendations. Getting Around You will need a car if you are going to take trips (and there are a lot of pretty places to visit around here). However, if you are coming up from the city just to get away for a few days and enjoy the country air, we'd be happy to work out a Bethel Train Station run at no extra cost - if we can make it work with our schedule. Other Things to Note We have two hens - Trumpet and Zephyr. We also have a gecko (Perseus) who lives in a terrarium in the kitchen.

It is blocks from Yale and in the Wooster Square area (great farmer's market on Saturdays!) offering some of the best pizza around.

It not only has great pizzerias (of course!) but great food options outside of pizza as well. Wonderful Farmers markets, nearby hikes, waterfront vistas and, of course, the university offerings of music, theatre/plays and arts in general. All of which are excellent. I highly recommend visiting the BAC (British Art Center) on Chapel St. and across the street from it the recently renovated Yale University Art Gallery. Just down the street from there is the well renowned Yale Repertory Theatre. Please don't hesitate to ask for any recommendations - we have plenty and love to offer up our favorites. :-) Getting Around Should you have a car, there is on-street parking on Jefferson street (the side street of the building). It is usually easy to find a spot. Should that prove difficult, there is additional parking further down Jefferson and on Grand Avenue. If on-street is a problem for you, please ask and I can usually provide off-street parking for a reasonable fee. Thanks! For Yale visiting scholars / guests there is the Yale Shuttle Bus which stops directly in front of the building to take one to the various departmental buildings. 2 blocks away is the State street train station. Uber taxi service has a strong/reliable presence in the city and a very convenient way to get around should the weather not cooperate. Other Things to Note Please enjoy yourself while here. It is very private, but very centrally located. We just hope you have a lovely, comfortable stay. + More","House Rules There is no smoking allowed anywhere on or around the premises.

Its was always filled with love.... ----------------------------------- Date of stay 05/11/13 Review Submitted 05/22/13 .Absolutely loved this house and will definitely plan on staying here again! My husband is originally from Connecticut and his entire family still lives there. Traditionally we stay with family when we visit but I decided to rent a house this trip so we could entertain and have everyone over. This house was charming and very comfortable. It was my mother in laws 80th birthday and I had about 25 family members over for a dinner party. Every person who entered the house commented on what a terrific cottage it was. Having the upstairs loft was a perfect space for my son to have his privacy and a place to relax. He (and I) loved having the wireless internet connection that worked great! The outdoor area was very private and the deck was a wonderful space to hang out and kick back. Everyone really enjoyed the art work throughout the house and commented that it provided warmth and character to the cottage. Lastly I want to share my comments on the owner Yvette, she was very prompt in her responses to me and a real pleasure to work with through the rental process. Yvette thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home with us, it was the most memorable visit to Connecticut that our family has ever had. Take care, my best, Julianna (This was the first time I ever rented a home online or used the Home Away site, it was a great experience!) Our Beach house is tucked away in a quiet private Connecticut shoreline neighborhood. Bike or flip-flop to our private beach and fishing pier.

So when I decided to list on AirB&B, I chose to include meal access with the room!! Now I am no world renown chef, but I know my way around the kitchen and can cook some great Italian food.

(It is listed as 14 nights because it does not show up on the Airbnb browser if a 30 night minimum stay is noted. I'm sorry for any confusion this may cause.) A classic 1930s beach cottage with an uncluttered interior, beautiful light, incredible views and an inviting deck. It's a great place to unwind with friends or just a special loved one. It's perfect for two couples as there's a bedroom and living area on each floor. But it's also a wonderful place for families, with lots of room to play inside and out. The cottage, recently re-constructed and furnished by local artists, has an open floor plan and casual furnishings. In addition to a bedroom, the first floor has an open kitchen, eating and living area that opens out onto a large deck overlooking the water. A second bedroom with dressing room and a spacious living area comprise the second floor. The recently renovated bathroom has a rainfall shower head and pebble shower floor. When the temperature dips, a wood stove provides warmth and adds to the charm. The upstairs living area has a daybed which can be used for a fifth guest. You'll find yourself on the deck at all hours. It's a fantastic place to relax and enjoy a drink and the view. [ NOTE: When Hurricane Sandy stormed through our region, it ripped our deck off. We won't have the deck fully repaired until this fall. In the meantime, we've replaced it with a smaller deck which you see in the photos above. Luckily the rest of our cottage is fine and is as shown in the photos. ] Walking and biking are favorite past times. Sailing, wind-surfing, golf, fishing, and bird watching are other popular activities. Make sure not to miss a trip to Marnick's, a venerable seaside diner just down the way, for ice cream and family meals.

Easy off street parking. 2 m to train & Greenwich restaurants.,"Description The Space This sun filled glass greenhouse guest room looks out over a nearly one acre organic maple grove forest, fledgling chutney orchard, and the Mianus River. We can offer sunset paddling as well as hilltop views over the top of an evolving organic veg/fruit/herb garden to the 52 acre river beyond. The Cozy Glass House Companion Listing comes to life in the warmer weather. The plants then migrate to their winter digs and guests can continue to enjoy a greenhouse guest room experience throughout the winter. This River Room is attached to the house and has centralized radiant heat. It is a wonderfully light place to rest and/or use as a base for exploring the area. Come to this gracious home on a peaceful, spacious property that is convenient to a wide range of ways to spend your time. Airbnb earnings will be donated to the ongoing water-energy research underway at the Burleson Institute. As a result, guests may engage with the river at the same time as be able to deduct taxes for contributing to our 501(c)3 educational nonprofit organization. While the house is a 250-year-old barn used to bring potatoes by boat to New Amsterdam, it is newly renovated and the glass sunroom is perfect for one or two people. The house is solar powered! We tap our maple trees and can offer solar maple scones on some weekends. The nearby Mianus River Gorge is the first piece of land ever set aside by the Nature Conservancy. The next stretch of water is owned by the water company and well preserved from regional development. We benefit from being able to wander out the backdoor and walk down a 2-minute path to our dock where we spend many afternoons kayaking down to where the river opens into Cos Cob's harbor on the Long Island Sound. The wildlife benefits from an aquatic habitat that qualifies as backup drinking water and that features a fish ladder at the edge of the small hydro dam that helped power train transport to and from NYC. Herons and other shore birds often sit on the dam to fish for dinner. Guests have a full bed. Water is from the river (via the water companies state of the art purification process). We have a wide array of books if you would like to explore birding, wildlife, global geopolitics, sustainability, and literature. We offer a days worth of coffee, tea, sugar, and milk and a few staples if you arrive late and have not had an opportunity to buy food. We are easy going, kind people who would like to make sure you feel welcome and cared for in what has been for us a wonderful place to feel peaceful. We write and curate rotating water, energy, climate Institute expos on behalf of our nonprofit Burleson Institute. We also gather information on watershed wildlife and contribute to Cornell's northeast bird count. We donate 20% of proceeds from hosting guests to our Burleson Institute's sustainability research initiatives. Feel free to count the wildlife you see while kayaking. By volunteering with the wildlife citizens science service learning and staying with us, you can help advance our energy-climate-water network of evolving best practices. Our neighborhood is not free from lawn services using mowers but it often is a tranquil get-away while also offering a trampoline from which to explore foodie and cultural options galore with substantial boating, hiking, fishing, etc. Our front step is a historic mill stone and our rooms within offer an eclectic array of artwork, instruments, and much loved multi-media research library encompassing: naturalist, international law, and innovative ways to respond effectively and equitably to the pressing issues of our era. We consider one or two members of our wildlife community semi-wild pets given their peaceful presence in our backyard. Peter and Ben Bunny can often be spotted chomping on grass in the backyard. Blue Herons and Egrets take refuge at our dock as do migrating families of ducks. Baby ducklings and swan signets are common in the late spring and summer and turtles can be seen sunning themselves on rocks and logs until the river freezes and makes way for cross country skiers, skaters, and ice fishermen. Enjoy our solar loft library including great artwork, books, instruments from around the world, and music recordings. David is fluent in Spanish and Betsy creatively conversant. We can offer use of a portable DVD player / and a range of films as well as internet. Shopping for groceries ranges from a Shop and Stop 2 miles away to Trader Joes, Fairway, and Whole Foods within 10 miles. The town excels at offering foodies an exquisite range of culinary opportunities. We would be happy to share our favorites (a seafood restaurant around the corner from the Norwalk Maritime Center where we like to see the latest Imax film. We also like picking up famous CT pizza from Pizza Post (better than Mystic Pizza) and having picnics at the beach. Folks have been enjoying the Little Pub, Mumbai Times, Louie's, Thai Basil Restaurant, Meli-Melo, and Versailles. Crossing over to the NY Historic Hudson Valley or hop a train into NYC changes the flavor of the culinary and cultural offerings. We often prefer to experiment with our garden harvest and CSA organic veg box by making curries, stews, chilies, chowders, gazpacho and the like. Our maple syrup cookbook is expanding into a solar cookbook and international cookbook... all still evolving. The glass house features a solar cooker for you to have fun with if the weather permits. Alternatively, you can bring back goodies and store them in the solar powered DC fridge. Backup house power is also available for the boat batteries that run the hilltop amenities. For anyone who lived through Superstorm Sandy, Katrina or their siblings, we seek to offer hands on innovation opportunities with resilience resources. Solar power has cut our electric bill in halve and a separate off grid array allows solar glass house guests a unique glamping experience. Enjoy Greenwich downtown pedestrian marketplace with outside eateries, interesting shops, and a small farmer's market on Saturdays (other towns in the area have farmer's market days throughout the week). There are many fine restaurants to choose from, and enjoy NYC's vibrant arts scene, with museums, galleries, and dozens of music and performances daily. There are very few places to stay in the area that have the rare combination of kayaking off a waterfront dock in the backyard as well as easy train access into NYC and a cosy comfy bed at a reasonable cost. Plush bedding and fluffy spa towels allows guests to have a soft energy footprint in style. Guest Access We offer local riverbank honey, muesli, and fruit. Bed sheets, towels/washcloths, shampoo/soaps, and a few dishes/utensils are provided in a creative manner that hopefully will make you smile at the choice and layout of amenities. Our sun room also serves as the institute library's international collection. Generally, we would like to keep the guest list to 2 as we already wear many hats with consultancy and NGO energy-climate work. We have a great deal of experience hosting United Nations and nonprofit folks since we moved to our beloved river in 1981. We have more than enough to do as authors publishing on strict deadlines but are also happy to offer any expertise on the area. David's wife, Nan can out-kayak all of us put together and is wonderful at spotting birdlife, having been an Audubon teacher naturalist since 1991 and Nature Conservancy naturalist prior to that. Yet, she is now creatively fishing for words at almost 80. She will speak of getting the soup out of the trees when discussing our maple syrup. We seek to model resilience gracefully. One private parking space will be marked with the Airbnb logo. There is a safe area to store bikes and storage of one or two bags. In addition to games/puzzles, we can offer hammock, tetherball, zimzam tennis pole and kayaking. We might also be willing to rent out our waterproof cannon camera for wildlife photography if it is not needed for institute activities. David is generally around while Nan and Elizabeth are often outdoors in the late afternoon. The doorbell is on the outside of the entryway rather than right next to the front door. Interaction with Guests When we travel we enjoy unique, comfortable, convenient lodging experiences. When hosting, we strive to offer the same. We have explored all 50 states in the US and a good portion of the world (over 60 countries). We greatly enjoy being out in nature and hosting the kind souls that have graced this retreat since 1981 (while we are new to hosting through Air bnb). We often keep to ourselves and are quiet but are happy to offer ideas for activities in the region. We often are engaged in independent projects including Bu(URL HIDDEN) but also really enjoy sharing ideas for things to do in the area (e.g. NYC museums, nature preserves in New England, boat trips, etc.) We enjoy a bit of gardening, plant knowledge, wilderness wandering and wildlife photography. We can chat over cups of Ben and Jerry's or maple scones... and can point out good coffee shops, restaurants, deli shops that can prepare picnic sandwiches for a day in the woods or on the water. As we live on site, we can be available to help and give any recommendations you might like to have - we've lived here for over 30 years and know the area. The Neighborhood Relax and unwind in this back bank river hideaway. Quiet, family-friendly neighborhood, where folks walk dogs, jog, etc. I love the neighborhood as it is walking distance to wooded parks with extensive trails for hiking, cycling, and cross country skiing. The river is stocked with trout and many wading fly fishermen brave the chilly Feb. waters in late winter/early spring. This extensive forested trail system encompasses over 300 acres of woods. You would not know that you are 30 miles from the heart of NYC. Yet, there are one or two renovations underway in the neighborhood. Coastal views can be enjoyed at the Cos Cob Park year round and with open access to Greenwich beach in the winter and access with purchased day passes in the summer. We have some of these passes available at the house. Stunning sunsets over Long Island Sound can be enjoyed while picnicking out at the beach. Many folks dock boats in Cos Cob Harbor, both seasonally and as they rock hop up and down the Atlantic Coast. Cos Cob's fish shop, cheese shop, artisan smoothie shop, tea house, farmers market and quiet historic neighborhood streets allow for a peaceful yet cosmopolitan get away without a substantial trek from regional hubs. The town is celebrating its 375th year in 2015 and has several revolutionary era museums including the Bush-Holly House and Putnam Cottage. Science and art exhibits can be viewed at our Bruce Museum and National Audubon Center as well as in NYC (my favorite is the Frick collection of Dutch art for its use of light and contrast). Visitors often alternate days in the big apple with relaxing seafood forays up the Connecticut coast, stopping at the Norwalk Maritime Center www.m(URL HIDDEN) to see marine life of Long Island Sound, including loggerhead turtles, sea horses, tiger sharks, and harbor seals. A ferry ride can take visitors to tour a historic lighthouse. In addition to Native American, naturalist, maritime, and revolutionary / colonial cultural opportunities, this area has become a diverse cosmopolitan community (despite still calling itself a town). The students at Greenwich High School speak over 35 languages. Lonely Planet notes that the ""southwestern corner of Connecticut, otherwise known as the Gold Coast, was once home to potato farmers and fishermen until 19th-century railroads brought New Yorkers north. With their blue-chip companies they transformed Fairfield County into one of the wealthiest regions in America with the affluent town of Greenwich at its heart."" One of our favorite summer activities is to take a ferry out to Great Captains Island and/or Island Beach to enjoy Long Island Sound then return and kayak/swim on the Mianus River. We cross country ski and skate the river (chatting with ice fishermen) and surrounding woods in the winter and into the spring. Daily hiking and swimming at base camp inspire us to do extensive outreach in our areas of humanitarian and climate coordination globally. We find Cos Cob a wonderful place from which to mix all of these experiences together. We have been known to muck out to the far reaches of the beach for shell fish then dash home to put on suits to attend heads of state negotiations at the United Nations. Feel free to fold into our sustainability initiatives at our institute headquarters, meditate along the river bank, or day trip up and down the coast. Getting Around Restaurants, nature centers/trails, arboretums, farmer's markets, sailing, swimming, kayaking, theatre, museums, high end shopping, and movies are all available within several miles. It's a 10 minute cab ride to the train station and then a 50 minute Metro North train ride to Grand Central Station (jumping off point for NYC fun). Check out weekly events posted by Timeout New (EMAIL HIDDEN) Many guests take a taxi to and from JFK or other regional airports. If city savvy and not pressed for time, hop the train into Grand Central and then cross the street to the express airport buses for Newark, JFK, or Laguardia (they leave from slightly different streets within a few blocks from Grand Central Station (costs under $20 one way for the bus while the train depends on whether one catches a peak or off peak train but will generally set one back $15 one way.) A faster, easier way of reaching the airports includes several shuttles that leave from hotels (including my standard approach of taking the Red Dot Shuttle from Greenwich Hyatt which leaves roughly every two hours throughout the day.) Buses become less useful in Greenwich beyond the main arteries. Amtrak express options stop at nearby Stamford station, which is a roughly $12 taxi ride away. We have maps for planning road trips north, south, or west. We can download nautical maps in the eastward direction or help determine coastal ferry schedules. Other Things to Note Very cozy and close to the beach and town. Perfect for a weekend getaway. The property is a river bank National Wildlife Federation Nature Preserve. Marina, Water Club, Greenwich Racket Club, Tennis, and Golf are all within 2 miles. 15 minute walk (5 minute drive) to beautiful 300 acres natural reserve. This sun filled room commands a gorgeous river view. Bring layers as New England weather can be variable throughout the day and from season to season. We cross country ski the river and woods in winter, tap maple trees in spring, kayak as long as there is a free channel of open water, and swim from June to September. Guests fish and shellfish, hike, boat inland and coastal waterways. There are a number of restaurants that will deliver. Otherwise, we would advise a car unless a half mile walk to restaurants is enjoyable for you. While close proximity to the city and easy safe parking for a car, we are neither remote wilderness nor urban. There are one or two renovations underway in the neighborhood. We are a unique river front with easy train access to mega NYC cultural and foodie offerings while also offering our backyard dock from which to launch kayaks. This is a suburban area where public transport is at least a mile walk. Great birding (esp. since we have no pets so are pet allergy friendly - anyone allergic to maple forests should strategize accordingly.) The glass house is a colorful tiny clear glass cabin (with optional curtain screens) perched at the top of a glacial erratic outcropping that has evolved into a rock garden, which looks over a large sunny lawn and forested river bank. It is about 80 sq ft so compare it with a tent rather than a hotel room experience) but is well finished with a very comfortable full bed. It is cozy, creative, and clean. It also has electricity and an electric space heater. The inside river room glass greenhouse is overflow for the glass house (in the warmer months) for families that bring a third person (glass house only fits 1-2). We generally block the river room listing in the summer but occasionally list it so do check with us. It is often listed throughout the cooler season. Five minute drive to Cos Cob egg/bacon sandwiches or elegant tea house meals served in high style (pastries, 4 tiers of tea sandwiches, and perfect espresso). 10 minute drive to Greenwich Ave. restaurants and other attractions. Greenwich is known for its vibrant downtown full of many shops, restaurants for all budgets (we like eating gyros at John's concession at Greenwich beach looking out over the ocean and happy children playing in the sand and picking up sea stuff (drift wood, mussel shells, Irish Moss) The area has an active arts and music scene. + More","House Rules We use the sunroom often for our own guests and we live on the property in a historic 250 year old barn built from American chestnut. We request that our guests be respectful of our quiet, peaceful neighborhood. (Quiet time from 9:45 pm to 8:45 am). We welcome our one or two chosen guests - not parties or loud behavior. Please park in front of the garage parallel to the road so we can keep the circular driveway free. We are not a hotel nor a bed & breakfast. This is our home and in the spirit of Airbnb we share our gorgeous waterfront with global travelers who seek to experience a unique sunroom sustainability retreat. We would be happy to exchange stories about global exploration or let guests enjoy our National Wildlife Federation nature preserve where it is easy to spot turtles, herons, egrets, king fishers, osprey, swans, ducks and an occasional bald eagle. This is a smoke/alcohol free property -- both inside and outside. Pets are not allowed (service animals are the only exception). Off street parking is available for one car in our driveway. This can be particularly important in the winter. If you would like to have one or two people over for a short time then please check with us ahead of time. We reserve the right to approve other people to avoid having gatherings that disturb kind neighbors. Check-in is at 3 pm and Check-out by 11 am. We sometimes can be flexible if you discuss your plans with us first. In the New England tradition, we generally take off our shoes and leave them in the mudroom by the front door or in the back entryway. We also expect folks to use water and energy wisely. Please check with us before lighting candles or fires of any kind as we take precautions against fire spreading. Portable barbeque grills may not be used on the property. We have a solar powered electric grill and may offer an outdoor wood fire in one of two outdoor fireplaces if there is not a local fire restriction due to overly dry conditions. We make sure there is a plentiful supply of water in the rainwater harvesting buckets and that the hose is turned on and ready for fire backup use. Fortunately, New England does not experience as many fire/drought issues as out west but we still respect the power of fire. Have a peaceful stay!

The two-bedroom, one-bath house has undergone a top-to-bottom interior restoration and a systems overhaul, which means you can bask in period charm (bay windows, a claw-foot tub, exposed-beam ceilings) without forgoing the ease of modern conveniences (reliable plumbing and electricity).

The house is spacious and open with high ceilings and lots of windows including an original stained glass window that stands on the main staircase landing. The house is nicely furnished - I think it's pretty but not the least bit stuffy. Just comfortable. Its a great house for entertaining.

It is a short drive to Essex and the Connecticut River and a shorter drive to Mystic and the Mystic River. And yes, there really is a Mystic Pizza. But there is also the Mystic Acquarium and the Mystic Seaport. But New London has it all. First, it is home to some of the oldest homes in the state, the Hempstead Houses. Really interesting especially if your visit coincides with some of their living history weekends. New London is also home to the Maritime Society that operates the New London Customs House - the oldest customs house in the state. Beautiful and very interesting. New London is also the transportation hub of southeastern Connecticut with an Amtrak stop, bus and taxi service and of course ferries to Fisher's Island, the north shore of Long Island and Block Island. Local public transportation is a little iffy but it's there and you can reach the surrounding towns and the two nearby casinos by bus. Downtown New London has an interesting mix of the performing and visual arts, an extensive array of restaurants from Thai, Sushi, Italian to good old American steaks, burgers, wings and fries. There's a great waterfront park where visitors can walk along the Thames River and take in the local river traffic including the occasional submarine making its way to the New London Submarine Base in Groton. + More",House Rules I don't have a lot of rules.

Views of coastal CT,RI, and NY, comfy beds, lovely bathrooms, just minutes from beaches, ports, and shops.","Description The Space Our house is located in the Lower East side of the village, within a block of the water, surrounded by stately mansions and an old barn, yet strangely private and quiet. Shops and restaurants are within a three minute walk from the house. A three-story Victorian built in 1902, it is a house full of character and yet recently renovated and comfortable with two new full bathrooms and a new kitchen. Enjoy the breezes by sitting on the rear deck or sitting in the cottage garden surrounded by roses, a pear tree, grape arbor and an ancient quince. The third floor is entirely private with two sleeping areas divided by a stair case, one containing a sturdy, comfortable pull-out twin bed and the other with an antique twin-plus bed and a twin trundle beneath it which can be placed in the adjacent yoga room for more privacy if desired. The space sleeps three comfortably. Please be aware that the stairs to the third floor are steep and somewhat narrow. Please see the photo of the staircase if this is a concern. Also, the ceilings in the dormers are 5'11, so one must mind one's head in places. The sun will waken you as the windows on the eastern side face the water directly and the windows let in full sunshine, so pull down the shades to sleep in after dawn. Stunning views of Watch Hill, Little Narragansett Bay, Fisher's Island Sound and Stonington Harbor can be seen from vantage points throughout the space. There is a small yoga and meditation room attached to the sleeping areas via a doorway complete with a yoga wall with ropes, for those who wish to begin or end their day with yoga practice. Feel free to use the bicycles, kayaks, and beach chairs during your stay. We often lay out an informal, complimentary continental breakfast for our guests, though it is not a listed amenity. UPDATE: We have just adopted two short-haired cats. They are not allowed in any bedroom areas and they keep to themselves. Guest Access Guests may use living room, deck, porch and garden. They may use the 2nd floor bathroom which will be shared, though we will do our best to use the lower floor bathroom to give you freer access to the upper bath. There is only one front door and one rear door to the house. Please use the front door only. If breakfast is offered, which is an informal complimentary continental meal, guests may access the kitchen. Interaction with Guests We are new Airbnb hosts and we hope to evolve as we go along, responding to the needs of our guests. We will be delighted to give you tips about the area but we also respect visitors' need for privacy. Life here is casual and my husband Stuart and I flow in and out of the house constantly, and leave our guests to their own devices . We often lay out a continental breakfast for our guests, but please don't enquire nor depend on this hospitality as it is not included in our amenities. The Neighborhood Stonington, CT was listed in Yankee Magazine's Top-10 Coastal Towns in 2015. The Borough is a unique fishing village situated on a small peninsula with public access to the shoreline throughout. With its history extending back to pre-Revolutionary times, the houses and architecture here span almost three centuries. Main St. is a charming place to stroll, window shop on Water St., enjoy great restaurants, visit the Point with its vistas of the Harbor, Fisher's Island, Watch Hill, Mystic Seaport and Groton in 270 degree views. Visit the beach or walk out on the old stone pier, take a sailing lesson at NESS, or pull in to Dodson's Boatyard on your own boat. The Lighthouse Museum is down the street and offers walking tours of the historical village. The area is chock full of antiquing, thrift shops, farmer's markets, lobster and seafood shacks, and don't miss the Velvet Mill which contains a whole variety of craft artisans, a brewery, a cheese shop, a bakery, galleries and shops in an old brick textile factory on the village outskirts. Mystic Seaport and Village, Pequot Museum, Mystic Aquarium and the vibrant town of Westerly, RI are all within a few miles of Stonington. And in the Autumn, leaf peepers make a pilgrimage to this lovely area to take in the stunning New England Fall foliage display. The stone walls themselves are numerous and mysterious, and seem to give this magical place its true name. Stunning beaches of Rhode Island are within a 20-minute drive, for swimming, surfing and sunbathing. But boating seems to be the favorite sport hereabouts and there are plenty of coves, harbors and miles of shoreline to explore. Barn Island is a wildlife sanctuary full of trails for hiking, boating, hunting and fishing. Getting Around There is no public transportation, so you will need your own two feet, plus a boat, bike, or automobile to get around. Uber taxis are available, Enterprise car rentals and the Amtrak train stations connecting Boston to DC are close by in Mystic, CT, Westerly, RI, and New London, CT. Southeastern CT Coastal train lines connect to New Haven and NYC. Other Things to Note In summer the Borough of Stonington is busy and full of people, cars, especially on the weekends. Street parking can get tight, though we have a driveway which can accommodate two vehicles when necessary. The week days are much more quiet here, especially after mid-October when the pace and population of the village slows down to only its year-round inhabitants. + More","House Rules Guests are requested to keep things low-key and quiet between the hours of 10 pm and 7 am.

This is a wonderful area for biking, also has many walking trails.","Description The Space It is said, If you have two pennies, with the first buy bread and with the second buy hyacinths for your soul."" Our 1710 colonial home, offers THREE large guestrooms (each rented separately), private jetted baths, fireplaces, gardens and quiet country setting near the heart of Mystic. NONE of our rooms accommodate more than 2 adults and 1 small child so plan accordingly when requesting your reservation. Rental is priced per room and we can and do accommodate multiple groups of travelers. The base price is for 1 person and there is an additional $20 for a second person in that room. If you have 4 people in your group, that would be 2 rooms plus $20 extra each room for double occupancy. Airbnb calculates the rate as if all 4 people fit in one room but that is not what you would be renting! Hope this makes sense but some folks have been confused so we're trying to explain it. :) Within three miles of downtown Mystic, historic Stonington Borough, the Aquarium, and the Seaport, our home sits on 4 1/2 acres of gardens, fields and forest. Excellent opportunities abound for quiet, romantic walks or secluded hideaways for reading. Relax in the ambiance of a home that has for three centuries provided shelter and respite. Our three guestrooms are beautifully appointed including such amenities as WiFi, hair dryers, cable TV/DVD/VCR, individual refrigerators, and irons and ironing boards.

There's a great coffee shop (The Yellow House) two miles away in Stonington Borough as well as several great cafes and restaurants for those who want a heartier start to their day during the week.

Easy off street parking. 2 m to train & Greenwich restaurants.","Description The Space This great New England river front glass house lives on our nearly one acre organic maple grove forest and fledgling chutney orchard. The companion Riverview listing is available when the Cosy Glass House is closed for the cooler season. The plants migrate into our greenhouse/glass house attached to our 250 year old house. Both listings offer sunset paddling as well as hilltop views over the top of an evolving organic veg/fruit/herb garden to the 52 acre river beyond. airbnb earnings will be donated to the ongoing water-energy research underway at the Burleson Institute. As a result, guests may engage with the river at the same time as be able to deduct taxes for contributing to our 501(c)3 educational nonprofit. Come to this gracious home on a peaceful, spacious property that is convenient to a wide range of ways to spend your time. In addition to easy access to NCY by train, we are a 25 minute drive from tours of the famous Philip Johnson Glass House. Ours differs in style and prestige being a Junior Victorian, actively used, greenhouse. We love sharing our waterfront access to a very special river. The nearby Mianus River Gorge is the first piece of land ever set aside by the Nature Conservancy. The next stretch of water is owned by the water company and well preserved from regional development. We benefit from being able to wander out the backdoor and walk down a 2-minute path to our dock where we spend many afternoons kayaking down to where the river opens into Cos Cob's harbor on the Long Island Sound. The wildlife benefits from an aquatic habitat that qualifies as backup drinking water and that features a fish ladder at the edge of the small hydro dam that helped power train transport to and from NYC. Herons and other shore birds often sit on the dam to fish for dinner. The glass house is perched atop a glacial erratic rock garden that marks the end of the last ice age. We love these stone outcroppings of standing stones and all the literarily lore that comes with ancient rock. While the house is a 250-year-old barn used to bring potatoes by boat to New Amsterdam, the glass house is a cosmopolitan newly renovated retreat that is wonderful for one or two people. We offer a contemporary solar powered green house with separate entrance and rainfed/heirloom gardens. We tap our maple trees and can offer solar maple scones on on some weekends. Guests have access to a full bed, camp chairs, tipi closet, shelf, toiletries, extra curtains tucked under shelf if privacy is preferable to clear view, solar powered electric portable DVD player, Internet, mini fridge, heater, grill, electric kettle, and French press coffee maker. Water is from the river (via the water companies state of the art purification process). We bring this water up to the glass house from the main house. The hilltop pebble patio area features patio chairs, tables and an outdoor historic stone oven / fireplace suited to making pizza. Feel free to use our heirloom garden herbs. The neighboring houses are well within view and there are one or two renovations underway in the neighborhood. If coming from city life it is very rustic. If coming from wilderness it may seem urban. We find that kayaking within 35 miles from all that NYC has to offer a real treat that mixes cultural and environmental interests. We have a wide array of books if you would like to relax on the hilltop. We can offer a days worth of coffee, tea, honey, milk and a few staples if you arrive late and have not had an opportunity to buy food. Extra curtains can help block heat/cold while a fan and skylight windows help cool the loft. We are easy going, kind people who would like to make sure you feel welcome and cared for in what has been for us a wonderful place to feel peaceful. We write and curate rotating water, energy, climate Institute expos on behalf of our nonprofit Burleson Institute. We also gather information on watershed wildlife and contribute to Cornell's northeast bird count. Feel free to get involved. We donate 20% of proceeds from hosting glass house guests to our Burleson Institute's sustainability research initiatives. By volunteering with the wildlife citizens science service learning and staying in the glass house as guests, you can help advance our energy-climate-water network of evolving best practices. Our neighborhood is not free from lawn services using mowers but it often is a tranquil get-away while also offering a trampoline from which to explore foodie and cultural options galore with substantial boating, hiking, fishing, etc. Our front step is a historic mill stone and our rooms within offer an eclectic array of artwork, instruments, and much loved multi-media research library encompassing: naturalist, international law, and innovative ways to respond effectively and equitably to the pressing issues of our era. We consider one or two members of our wildlife community semi-wild pets given their peaceful presence in out backyard. Peter and Ben Bunny can often be spotted chomping on grass out back. Blue Herons and Egrets take refuge at our dock as do migrating families of ducks. Baby ducklings and swan signets are common in the late spring and summer. Turtles can be seen sunning themselves on rocks and logs until the river freezes and makes way for cross country skiers, skaters, and ice fishermen. Enjoy our solar loft library including great artwork, books, instruments from around the world, and music recordings. David is fluent in Spanish and Betsy creatively conversant. We can offer use of a portable DVD player / and a range of films as well as internet. Shopping for groceries ranges from a Shop and Stop 2 miles away to Trader Joes, Fairway, and Whole Foods within 10 miles. The town excels at offering foodies an exquisite range of culinary opportunities. We would be happy to share our favorites (a seafood restaurant around the corner from the Norwalk Maritime Center where we like to see the latest Imax film. We also like picking up famous CT pizza from Pizza Post (better than Mystic Pizza) and having picnics at the beach. Folks have been enjoying the Little Pub, Mumbai Times, Louie's, Thai Basil Restaurant, Meli-Melo, and Versailles. Crossing over to the NY Historic Hudson Valley or hop a train into NYC changes the flavor of the culinary and cultural offerings. We often prefer to experiment with our CSA organic veg box by making stews, chilies, chowders, gazpacho and the like. Our maple syrup cookbook is expanding into a solar cookbook and international cookbook... all still evolving. The glass house features a solar cooker for you to have fun with if the weather permits. Alternatively, you can bring back goodies and store them in the solar powered DC fridge. Backup house power is also available for the boat batteries that run the hilltop amenities. For anyone who lived through Superstorm Sandy, Katrina or their siblings, we seek to offer hands on innovation opportunities with resilience resources. Solar power has cut our electric bill in halve and a separate off grid array allows solar glass house guests a unique glamping experience. Enjoy Greenwich downtown pedestrian marketplace with outside eateries, interesting shops, and a small farmer's market on Saturdays (other towns in the area have farmer's market days throughout the week). There are many fine restaurants to choose from, and enjoy NYC's vibrant arts scene, with museums, galleries, and dozens of music and performances daily. There are very few places to stay in the area that have the rare combination of kayaking off a waterfront dock in the backyard as well as easy train access into NYC and a cosy comfy bed at a reasonable cost. Plush bedding, fluffy spa towels, and use of a solar powered washer/dryer allows guests to have a soft energy footprint in style. Guest Access We offer a sampling of culinary goodies to get glamping off to a fun start including local riverbank honey, a diversity of granola / muesli, and juice). The glass house is perfect for two people, so on rare occasion we might be in a position to offer a futon for a third family member in the main house (also commanding stunning river views but not nearly as unique an experience as the solar glass house.) (Occasional backup inclement weather access to recently renovated shared family guest bathroom in late 1800s main house). David is 83 and can walk the 2-minute pebble path to the glass house, that said, the incline might be steep for a self propelled scooter. A family member could likely push a wheel chair up to the glass house. This would be an occasion upon which to offer a futon in the sunroom of the main house that is otherwise part of the institute library's international collection. Alternatively, there is plenty of lawn space to pitch the occasional tent in nice weather. Generally, we would like to keep the guest list to 2 as we already wear many hats with consultancy and NGO energy-climate work. We have a great deal of experience hosting United Nations and nonprofit folks since we moved to our beloved river in 1981. We have more than enough to do as authors publishing on strict deadlines but are also happy to offer any expertise on the area. David's wife, Nan can out-kayak all of us put together and is wonderful at spotting birdlife, having been an Audubon teacher naturalist since 1991 and Nature Conservancy naturalist prior to that. Yet, she is now creatively fishing for words at almost 80. She will speak of getting the soup out of the trees when discussing our maple syrup. We seek to model resilience gracefully. One private parking space will be marked with the Airbnb logo. There is a safe area to store bikes and storage of one or two bags. In addition to games/puzzles, we can offer hammock, tetherball, zimzam tennis pole and kayaking. We might also be willing to rent out our waterproof cannon camera for wildlife photography if it is not needed for institute activities. Bed sheets, towels/washcloths, shampoo/soaps, and a few dishes/utensils are provided in a creative manner that hopefully will make you smile at the choice and layout of amenities. David is generally around while Nan and Elizabeth are often outdoors in the late afternoon. The doorbell is on the outside of the entryway rather than right next to the front door. Interaction with Guests When we travel we enjoy unique, comfortable, convenient lodging experiences. When hosting, we strive to offer the same. We have explored all 50 states in the US and a good portion of the world (over 60 countries). We greatly enjoy being out in nature and hosting the kind souls that have graced this retreat since 1981 (while we are new to hosting through Air bnb). We often keep to ourselves and are quiet but are happy to offer ideas for activities in the region. We often are engaged in independent projects including www.Bu(URL HIDDEN) but also really enjoy sharing ideas for things to do in the area (e.g. NYC museums, nature preserves in New England, boat trips, etc.) We enjoy a bit of gardening, plant knowledge, wilderness wandering and wildlife photography. We can chat over cups of Ben and Jerry's or maple scones... and can point out good coffee shops, restaurants, deli shops that can prepare picnic sandwiches for a day in the woods or on the water. As we live on site, we can be available to help and give any recommendations you might like to have - we've lived here for over 30 years and know the area. The Neighborhood Relax and unwind in this back bank river hideaway. Quiet, family-friendly neighborhood, where folks walk dogs, jog, etc. I love the neighborhood as it is walking distance to wooded parks with extensive trails for hiking, cycling, and cross country skiing. The river is stocked with trout and many wading fly fishermen brave the chilly Feb. waters in late winter/early spring. This extensive forested trail system encompasses over 300 acres of woods. You would not know that you are 30 miles from the heart of NYC. Coastal views can be enjoyed at the Cos Cob Park year round and with open access to Greenwich beach in the winter and access with purchased day passes in the summer. We have some of these passes available at the house. Stunning sunsets over Long Island Sound can be enjoyed while picnicking out at the beach. Many folks dock boats in Cos Cob Harbor, both seasonally and as they rock hop up and down the Atlantic Coast. Cos Cob's fish shop, cheese shop, artisan smoothie shop, tea house, farmers market and quiet historic neighborhood streets allow for a peaceful yet cosmopolitan get away without a substantial trek from regional hubs. The town is celebrating its 375th year in 2015 and has several revolutionary era museums including the Bush-Holly House and Putnam Cottage. Science and art exhibits can be viewed at our Bruce Museum and National Audubon Center as well as in NYC (my favorite is the Frick collection of Dutch art for its use of light and contrast). Visitors often alternate days in the big apple with relaxing seafood forays up the Connecticut coast, stopping at the Norwalk Maritime Center www.m(URL HIDDEN) to see marine life of Long Island Sound, including loggerhead turtles, sea horses, tiger sharks, and harbor seals. A ferry ride can take visitors to tour a historic lighthouse. In addition to Native American, naturalist, maritime, and revolutionary / colonial cultural opportunities, this area has become a diverse cosmopolitan community (despite still calling itself a town). The students at Greenwich High School speak over 35 languages. Lonely Planet notes that the ""southwestern corner of Connecticut, otherwise known as the Gold Coast, was once home to potato farmers and fishermen until 19th-century railroads brought New Yorkers north. With their blue-chip companies they transformed Fairfield County into one of the wealthiest regions in America with the affluent town of Greenwich at its heart."" One of our favorite summer activities is to take a ferry out to Great Captains Island and/or Island Beach to enjoy Long Island Sound then return and kayak/swim on the Mianus River. We cross country ski and skate the river (chatting with ice fishermen) and surrounding woods in the winter and into the spring. Daily hiking and swimming at base camp inspire us to do extensive outreach in our areas of humanitarian and climate coordination globally. We find Cos Cob a wonderful place from which to mix all of these experiences together. We have been known to muck out to the far reaches of the beach for shell fish then dash home to put on suits to attend heads of state negotiations at the United Nations. Feel free to fold into our sustainability initiatives at our institute headquarters, meditate along the river bank, or day trip up and down the coast. Getting Around Restaurants, nature centers/trails, arboretums, farmer's markets, sailing, swimming, kayaking, theatre, museums, high end shopping, and movies are all available within several miles. It's a 10 minute cab ride to the train station and then a 50 minute MetroNorth train ride to Grand Central Station (jumping off point for NYC fun). Check out weekly events posted by Timeout New (EMAIL HIDDEN) Many guests take a taxi to and from JFK or other regional airports. If city savvy and not pressed for time, hop the commuter train (Metro North) into Grand Central and then cross the street to the express airport buses for Newark, JFK, or Laguardia (they leave from slightly different streets within a few blocks from Grand Central Station (costs under $20 one way for the bus while the train depends on whether one catches a peak or off peak train but will generally set one back $15 one way.) A faster, easier way of reaching the airports includes several shuttles that leave from hotels (including my standard approach of taking the Red Dot Shuttle from Greenwich Hyatt which leaves roughly every two hours throughout the day.) Buses become less useful in Greenwich beyond the main arteries. Amtrak express options stop at nearby Stamford station, which is a roughly $12 taxi ride away. We have maps for planning road trips north, south, or west. We can download nautical maps in the eastward direction or help determine coastal ferry schedules. Other Things to Note Very cozy and close to the beach and town. Perfect for a weekend getaway. The property is a river bank National Wildlife Federation Nature Preserve. Marina, Water Club, Greenwich Racket Club, Tennis, and Golf are all within 2 miles. 15 minute walk (5 minute drive) to beautiful 300 acres natural reserve. This Victorian glass house commands a gorgeous view at the top of a hill that takes about 2 minutes to walk up to from the main house. Bring layers as New England weather can be variable throughout the day and from season to season. We cross country ski the river and woods in winter, tap maple trees in spring, kayak as long as there is a free channel of open water, and swim from June to September. Guests fish and shellfish, hike, boat inland and coastal waterways. There are a number of restaurants that will deliver. Otherwise, we would advise a car unless a half mile walk to restaurants is enjoyable for you. While close proximity to the city and easy safe parking for a car, we are neither remote wilderness nor urban. We are a unique river front with easy train access to mega NYC cultural and foodie offerings while also offering our backyard dock from which to launch kayaks. This is a suburban area where public transport is at least a mile walk. Great birding (esp. since we have no pets so are pet allergy friendly - anyone allergic to maple forests should strategize accordingly.) The glass house is a colorful tiny clear glass cabin (with optional curtain screens) perched at the top of a glacial erratic outcropping that has evolved into a rock garden, which looks over a large sunny lawn and forested river bank. It is about 80 sq ft so compare it with a tent rather than a hotel room experience) but is well finished with a very comfortable full bed. It is cozy, creative, and clean. Has electricity (option 1: extension cord to solar powered main house or option 2: solar charged boat battery with red on/off switch on side and 2 regular outlets) and electric space heat. Five minute drive to Cos Cob egg/bacon sandwiches or elegant tea house meals served in high style (pastries, 4 tiers of tea sandwiches, and perfect espresso). 10 minute drive to Greenwich Ave. restaurants and other attractions. Greenwich is known for its vibrant downtown full of many shops, restaurants for all budgets (we like eating gyros at John's concession at Greenwich beach looking out over the ocean and happy children playing in the sand and picking up sea stuff (drift wood, mussel shells, Irish Moss) The area has an active arts and music scene. + More","House Rules We use the glass house often for our own guests and we live on the property in a historic 250 year old barn built from American chestnut. We request that our guests be respectful of our quiet, peaceful neighborhood. (Quiet time from 9:45 pm to 8:45 am). Please part in front of garage closest to the road so we can keep the circular drive free. We welcome our two chosen guests - not parties or loud behavior. We would be happy to facilitate fishing but ask that fish/seafood cleaning not occur in or immediately near the main house or glass house. This is not a place for gatherings or parties, rather a ""retreat"" in what really is a tiny glass house. It is glamping (glamorous camping) in a strategic (hotel cost in Greenwich range from $250-$300 nightly) and inspiring rare river access and city fun. Sustainability offerings include: (1) Off-grid composting toilet and solar powered shower, kettle, heater, fan, when renewable energy is on offer. (2) Extension cord and town water line when less adventuresome travelers do not want a complete off-grid experience and (3) Inclement weather occasional backup options to share a downstairs family guest bathroom. The outdoor experience is a rejuvenating one. We are not a hotel nor a bed & breakfast. This is our home and in the spirit of Airbnb we share our gorgeous waterfront with global travelers who seek to experience a unique glass house sustainability retreat. We would be happy to exchange stories about global exploration or let guests enjoy our National Wildlife Federation nature preserve where it is easy to spot turtles, herons, egrets, king fishers, osprey, swans, ducks and an occasional bald eagle. This is a smoke/alcohol free property -- both inside and outside. Pets are not allowed (service animals are the only exception). Off street parking is available for one car in our driveway. This can be particularly important in the winter. If you would like to have one or two people over for a short time then please check with us ahead of time. We reserve the right to approve other people to avoid having gatherings that disturb kind neighbors. Check-in is at 3 pm and Check-out by 11 am. We sometimes can be flexible if you discuss your plans with us first. In the New England tradition, we generally take off our shoes and leave them in the mudroom by the front door or in the back entryway. We also expect folks to use water and energy wisely. Please check with us before lighting candles or fires of any kind as we take precautions against fire spreading. Portable barbeque grills may not be used on the property. We have a solar powered electric grill and may offer an outdoor wood fire in one of two outdoor fireplaces if there is not a local fire restriction due to overly dry conditions. We make sure there is a plentiful supply of water in the rainwater harvesting buckets and that the hose is turned on and ready for fire backup use. Fortunately, New England does not experience as many fire/drought issues as out west but we still respect the power of fire. Winter river bon fires are good fun.

It is a two-family house with a door between the kitchens. The space is very flexible. I can offer one or two bedrooms with access to the kitchen or all of my side of the house except my office. The large bedroom (this listing) is at the back of the house, has a king bed, and faces the rising sun. Guests in this room share a bathroom with the small bedroom. I usually cannot accommodate last-minute bookings. Guest Access Guests are welcome to use the kitchen for making beverages or simple meals. The house has wireless Internet, but we do not have TV. There is only one TV. When the weather is good, guests are welcome to use the garden and the back area. I hesitate to call it a patio because it is where I pot plants, but it is where we grill and build fires. We have a battered fire pit and plenty of wood. I work at home, so my office is pretty much off limits, but everything is negotiable. Interaction with Guests I will be in the house during your stay. I may sleep in the small bedroom or in the apartment next door, so if any questions or problems come up, I'll be right here. If you need to do laundry, you must pass through my office to get to the laundry room, which is fine with me. The Neighborhood This is an ethnically and culturally mixed neighborhood, and it is mixed zoning. Clover Nook once housed a beauty parlor; we found two of those old-fashioned hair dryers with the huge hoods in the basement. Toward the end of the street stands a collection of very small houses that were probably built to house mill employees. At the very end is the house where the songwriter Henry Clay Work was born. Among his best-known tunes are ""Marching Through Georgia"" and ""My Grandfather's Clock."" There is a statue of Work on Middletown's South Green, which is a few blocks from the house. Downtown Restaurants (listed in order of distance, farthest away first) Tibetan Kitchen Located at 574 Main Street, Tibetan Kitchen is an unassuming little place with great food. I have no idea whether it is authentic, but it's certainly delicious. There is something for everyone here: curries, soups, dumplings, and more and lots of vegan and vegetarian options. BYOB (there is a corking fee). Bring patienceservice can be slow and the place can get very busy, but the wait is well worth it. Also bring cashno checks or credit cards are accepted. Closed Sundays. Iguanas Ranas Taquer_a Iguanas Ranas, 484 Main Street, is a family business that started small and keeps growing. I like everything I've had there but adore the fish tacos. The place gets noisy at night, so we usually go for lunch and try to get a table in the window. Full bar. Closed Sundays. Caf 56 Caf 56, at 102 Court Street, is one of our favorite Middletown restaurants. Open for breakfast and lunch, it features foods and culinary traditions from different countries and ethnicities. From the website: The goal at Caf 56 is to provide the customers with the experience of the different tastes from around the world."" The chef and owner is Sabrina Cortes, who is from Guatemala City. She also serves, buses tables, chats with everyone, and generally sees to everything. Ed Thereault bakes scones, croissants (real ones), country buttermilk biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and a variety of coffee cakes and muffins every morning. He also creates delicious desserts; some of his specialties include the Caf 56 red velveteen cake with caramel buttercream icing and a coconut lime cake. Closed Sundays. Fiore II Restaurant This Italian restaurant, at 332 Main Street, is very pretty inside and out. All the food looks wonderful, but I always end up ordering scampi and trying to talk someone into sharing a bowl of lobster bisque. Beer and wine are available. I don't know whether other alcohol is served, but I'll find out and revise this. Closed Mondays. Amici Italian Grill Amici's, 280 Main Street, specializes in northern Italian cooking. It has a full bar and is often crowded, especially on weekend nights. Open every day for lunch and dinner. Getting Around Middletown does have a bus system, and I have a schedule, but most people drive, walk, or bike. Parking at Clover Nook is available in the driveway. Other Things to Note When a guest arrived recently, she asked if we could recommend a good massage therapist. We said sure--ours. Lugging her table, Joan made a house call. Everyone was pleased, and Joan decided she would be happy to do it again. If anyone who books at Clover Nook would like to arrange for a massage, I will pass along Joan's number after the booking, and Joan and the guest can make whatever arrangement they like. We have an ancient cat who has the run of the house; however, she was never allowed in the large bedroom and hasn't been in the small bedroom for years. + More",House Rules No smoking is allowed in the house.

Were less than a five-minute walk to the quiet, public Morris Cove beach and about 0.7 mile to the beach and beautiful sunsets at Lighthouse Point Park. We're in the heart of the fairly quiet Morris Cove neighborhood. The busiest times are July 4 when the cars begin lining up before sunrise to get to the park at the end of the road; and during the winter when Easter Seals sponsors the Festival of Lights, when the cars line up for more than a mile to pay the $10 entry fee and see the holiday light sculptures ranging from animated lobsters and sailboats to electronic snowball fights. Krauszer's deli and quick mart is also minutes away by foot and has just about anything you might need from morning java (also available here at home) to veggies and the morning newspaper. Across the street from Krauszer's is Joey D's Italian food/pizzeria for lunch or dinner specialties. The neighborhood is walk-friendly with lots of runners and dogs. We love food here at what we call The Lighthouse. Our garden provides us with fresh strawberries, raspberries, black seeded Simpson lettuce, arugula and spinach when it's season. We hope to be pickling cukes before long and should have our own crop of Connecticut field 10"" pumpkins. The sage, dill, basil, parsley, oregano, marjoram, chives and thyme from our herb garden add lots of pizzazz to a spinach omelet and we regularly perk up our tea or lemonade with fresh spearmint, too. The sunflowers should be in bloom outside your window by the late summer as well. Just write if you want more pictures or more information. Guest Access House and garage are accessible to guests if you want to lock up your bike or one of ours. Admission to Lighthouse Park is free for pedestrians and cyclists. There is safe on-street parking and there is one space in the very far rear of the driveway due to there currently being two cars in the garage. Check in is best after 6 p.m. during the week seeing as we both work, but this should be discussed in advance as one of us may be able to meet you here earlier. Weekend check-in times should also be discussed as they would be dependent on our availability. Interaction with Guests If we're home and not busy with blogging or some such thing, then we're fairly early to bed and early to rise, but aside from that, we're pretty friendly folks, as is most of the neighborhood. The Neighborhood We are in a fairly quiet neighborhood on the other side of New Haven Harbor from Yale and downtown New Haven. We are about a 10-15 minute drive from Yale and about a 30-minute bus ride.

The Benedict House Cottage is a place to call home while exploring the area.","Description The Space Escape to a 5-acre estate in scenic and pristine Bethel, CT just 70 miles from NYC. This exquisite piece of New England history: The Oliver Benedict House on Codfish Hill. was built in 1796 and has had an incredible list of owners, including the one of the first families in Bethel (The Benedict Family), The (P.T.) Barnum Family and Helmsley/Spear Families. Your stay on Codfish Hill will be in the 200 year old converted milk barn with private entrance, beautiful loft, exposed barnwood beams, tons of natural light, Jacuzzi tub, and full bath with wilderness and wildlife all around you. The barn cottage (where you'll be staying) is flanked by beautiful gardens and adjacent open space. Codfish Hill is a great place for a relaxing getaway approximately 1hr from NYC.

We love our little farm property and can't wait to share it (and its stories) with you! The Neighborhood Bethel, CT is a charming town nestled in southwestern Fairfield County and is part of the Danbury metropolitan area. Bethel offers a rich colonial history, local flair and breathtaking rolling landscapes. The town is mostly residential and its main thoroughfare Greenwood Avenue has been designated as a Historic District. You can visit the other historic homes of Rev. John Ely and Seth Seelye - both on the National Register of Historic Places  The town is home to the Blue Jay Orchards for apple picking, Putnam Memorial State Park, Bennett Memorial Park and Taunton Pond. Also, for those who like to go antiquing, we have a variety of antique stores within 25 minutes in nearby Southbury and Woodbury. The Codfish Hill area of Bethel is among the most historic, rural and beautiful areas in New England. Located just north of Huntington State Park in Redding, hiking, biking, kayaking, snowshoeing and a host of other outdoor activities are right in our backyard. Getting Around As we are in the country, you will need a car. Some guests from NYC take Metro North to Bethel on the New Haven Line or Southeast on the Harlem Line and have Enterprise Car Rental meet them. If you need help figuring this out, we're happy to assist! There are also lots of car shares in the area. If desired guests can also rent our electric car (on site) through Turo (previously relay rides) at a discounted rate. Other Things to Note In 1976 the Bethel Historical Society and Bicentennial Commission published a book entitled A History of Bethel, A Commemorative Book"". There is a chapter of the book highlighting Bethel's eighteenth-century houses, one of which is our home. Because all early records were destroyed in the British Burning of Danbury not all historical data for our home has been readily available. So we have done some digging of our own. :) Oliver Benedict (the original owner of the farm at our address) and the Benedict family were one of the first families to have settled in Bethel, CT. In fact, Oliver's father, Benjamin was one of the original seventy-one members of the First Congregational Church in Bethel which was established in 1759. We know that Oliver's first child, Ira was born on June 3, 1772, and that he was paid 5 pounds In 1792 for his losses from the British as aresult of their march towards Danbury. This would confirm that he was living in Bethel in 1777 when 2,000 British troops led by General Tryon marched through Bethel on their way to burn the Revolutionary stores at Danbury. There are stories that tell of local patriots warning the Bethel citizens of the British advance. One such story tells of a lone rider seeing the British approaching from the top of Hoyts Hill and rode not unlike Paul Revere to alert their neighbors. The British, as the story is told, thinking they were being met by a considerable army, halted their forces and sent scouts ahead to see if they would be met by rebel forces. A descendant of Thomas Taylor (one of the early Bethel settlers and friend of the Benedict family) told a story that her grandmother was riding home when she sighted the British and dashed into Bethel shouting, The British are coming! The British are coming!"" We know in the coming days of 1977 some type of damage (likely to the house and outbuildings) was inflicted upon our home, our home also likely played a role in the British Invasion/plan. Codfish Hill Road was an established foraging camp during the invasion (for crops or animals for food), and many homes in the area were damaged at that time. + More","House Rules We love this home and know you will too.

Interaction with Guests I try to welcome you personally as much as possible, but we may not get a chance to meet. Text/call me when you are about to get into New Haven and we can take it from there :) The Neighborhood Fair Haven has had a bad reputation for being ""hood"" & ""sketchy"" for my international friends, that means 'poor and not well maintained' :/ But it's a lovely place. Fair Haven as well as our building (a former beer factory) has a lot of history. I've lived here for 6+ years. It's urban and it is in a city, so it can be a scary experience for some, but you'll be fine. Just be alert like you would be in any city or some place new. Cool things to note: Condo is nested in a lively and beautiful river community: fishing, jet skiis, commercial boats and kayaking, canoes, seagulls, swans and even rare osprey. 2 boat marinas on Front St. 2 movable bridges: Grand Ave Bridge (swing bridge) and Ferry St Bridge (bascule) Walk 5 minutes on Front St to Grand Ave and there are tons of restaurants. Most are ""Hispanic"" Latin American-centric foods, food trucks, etc. 10 minutes walk NE (on Front Street) you get the marinas and the boat house cafe with views of historical homes of Fair Haven along the way. 1.5 miles to downtown, Yale University and Morris Cove beach. Cab & Uber ride to train station/downtown is $8-15 C-Town and Rite-Aid are 5 blocks away - use Ferry St, by Citgo Gas Station. This part of Ferry St is as mentioned above, rough looking. I walk by there all the time and other than the cat-calls, it's fine. Getting Around Walking/cycling: 30/10 minutes gets you to downtown (restaurants, cafes, theatre, movies) Driving: 5-10 minutes to everything and I-95, I-91. Super traffic on Chapel & Grand during rush hour. Other Things to Note HIDDEN DRIVEWAY ALERT! Expect to get a little confused at entrance - it's a tricky entrance and GPS sometimes confuses our building with one next door. PRINTABLE GUIDE: New Haven is known for housing Yale of course, but it's also known for being a foodie town with a TON of history and things to do.

Woodstock, Connecticut is considered part of the ""Quiet Corner."" It is known for its ""tranquility, history and pastoral good looks,"" according to the guidebook 1,000 Places to See Before You Die. Woodstock is located in the northeastern corner of Connecticut. Area-wise, it is actually the second largest town in CT. Our population is still small (7,986 residents as of 2014) but growing. Our town is a rural, historic community with an agricultural background. Woodstock has more operating dairy farms than any other town in Connecticut. Support for open space conservation and the farming community is strong. The town also encourages light manufacturing and welcomes small businesses. There are many types of farms, craft shops, antique shops, and restaurants intermingled with light industry such as the manufacture of electrical switches, jet aircraft components, microporous plastics, fancy soaps and toiletries, fiberglass components, fine furniture and kitchen cabinets. A third of residents have college degrees, and a number of professionals run small businesses or telecommute from their homes. The scenery is spectacular, and the residents are friendly. In order to preserve the town's rural character and agricultural base, residents have adopted ""The Right to Farm Ordinance"" and created The Woodstock Land Preservation and Land Acquisition Fund.""

Or maybe you prefer to sit and read a book beside a babbling brook filled with koi fish. Our guest room is downstairs, separated from the rest of the bedrooms in the house. There is a half bath that is primarily used by the guests right outside the bedroom door. The shower is located in another bathroom two rooms away on the same floor.

During the summer, a fan or window air conditioning unit is available to keep the room comfortably cool. In the event that you would like to house more guests, that can be arranged upon request. The guest room attaches via a small hallway to a formal living room. Our guests often like to use this as their own private sitting area, as our family rarely uses it. Each season here has its own appeal. During the summer we love to grab an ice cream at Durham DariServe or drive 25 minutes down to Hammonassett State Beach. Fall means amazing maples dropping their jewel-colored leaves or taking in a Yale football game down in New Haven. In winter we can ice skate on frozen ponds in Durham or nearby Middlefield and then warm up with hot chocolate and nutella crepes at our favorite local coffee shop, Perk on Main.

If you want to venture beyond our property, you can hike on 60 acres of town-owned open space across the street. When you are done, perhaps you would like to sip creamy milk fresh from the jersey cows who make their home at the farm on that land. Getting Around Pick-up and drop-off is available at the New Haven train station for a small additional fee, making a visit to our home easy for those in New York or Boston looking for a break from city life.

It's a 1946 lake cottage with lots of character, being lovingly renovated and with great views. The cheerful good-sized guest room has views in three directions - up the mountain into my gardens, out to the lake and through an old apple tree. It is uncluttered and colorful, with a good reading lamp, computer desk and empty bureau. The single bed has a roll-out lower trundle that can be raised higher (almost, but not quite to the level of the upper bed) or used at floor level. Beds can be positioned side-by-side or rolled apart. The bath is shared - it's a one bathroom house. New mattress covers, pads, sheets, blankets and quilt cover the beds, which guests report are quite comfortable. There is great cellphone service in this neighborhood - not always the case in this mountainous area. Guest Access Full access to the kitchen and guests are welcome to help themselves to tea and coffee. A former sunporch across the front of the house is now a sunny winterized living room with a big couch ( a dreamy napping place), an armoire full of records and CDs and a dining/work table looking out over the lake. A big woodstove takes the chill off in winter, and open windows keep it breezy all summer. You're welcome to make yourself at home there or in the adjacent dining room. A big artist-made picnic table, bench and chairs give lots of places to enjoy the outdoors. If you've been out on the Appalachian Trail and need to do some laundry, you're welcome to use my machines. Interaction with Guests I often work at home, so some days I'll be in my office all day, some days I'll be on the run, it just depends on my schedule. I do enjoy company, especially at meal times, and have had a great time with guests who like to pitch in and do improvisational cooking together. Or if you prefer to be on your own, I'm happy to get guests situated, give directions and suggestions, and send them on their way to explore this beautiful part of the world. On weekends I'm more available. I'm always happy to give the grand tour of gardens and answer questions. The Neighborhood This is the country and there is no public transportation. It is just plain beautiful here - woods and water, mountains reflected in the lake. It's not fancy or pretentious or overdeveloped, just nice. The historic Bull's Bridge, one of the few still-operating covered bridges in the state, is around the corner and is a sight to see when the waters are rushing by. Kent is full of permanently protected open space and it's a short drive to access to miles and miles of hiking trails from easy to challenging. It is dark and quiet here at night. Kent Falls and Lake Waramaug are nearby along with art galleries, antiquing opportunities and great restaurants. Getting Around There is no public transportation. I'm happy to pick up AT hikers in town or at Bull's Bridge if my schedule permits. The South Kent School is a very short walk - you can see the hockey rink lit up at night from my house. Other Things to Note I hope that you will be comfortable and have an enjoyable stay. Please let me know if there is anything you need or if you would like restaurant, hiking or other recommendations. + More","House Rules No smoking, no drugs, no parties and please, no visiting pets or unannounced visitors.

House offers shared bathroom, kitchen, sunspace/dining room, living room and TV room. Broadband WiFi (average 20-25 mbps) and off-street parking also available. Breakfast items usually on offer include coffee, tea, yoghurts, bananas, oranges, cereals + milk, toast + jams and OJ. House is close (walkable 10-15 mins) to train/bus station and downtown venues (15-20 mins) as well as the West End; West Hartford (4 miles west) is best reached by bus or car. Local bus service is available right outside the front door ((URL HIDDEN) Route #76). There's also local (hourly) bus service from the airport (Route #30X) to downtown ($1.50 exact change) with an easy transfer (free upon request) to my neighborhood bus.

For any extended stays, use of the basement laundry facilities can be arranged. Interaction with Guests I generally enjoy meeting and chatting with my guests which is why I like to serve breakfast in the sunroom. However, if you really prefer your privacy I can always set out breakfast items in the kitchen which can be taken to the guest room for your private consumption.

We're in a great, super safe neighborhood, just a few minutes from downtown/Yale. Off street parking, easy access to public transportation and an easy bike ride to most of the city. Two beds, a jacuzzi tub and a fireplace.","Description The Space You'll mostly have your own floor of the house (finished walk out basement) with a king size bed and a big futon so that you can very comfortably sleep up to 4 in two separate areas. There is some stuff we might need access to, but generally we don't have much need to be down there. We may or may not share a bathroom when it's convenient for you (I think that shower is so much nicer!), but otherwise we generally keep away from your floor. Don't wanna wear pants to the bathroom in the morning? This is the perfect spot. You also get French doors that open up into the backyard right next to the bed, a gas fireplace and a jacuzzi tub. We're in a great neighborhood that avoids the biggest issue in New Haven; crime. Being just across the harbor we're insulated from the bad neighborhoods that run up against all the nice spots closer to downtown. We have parking behind the house (that you can use if you like) but I prefer to park in the street and have never had an issue. We live around all the firefighters and new professors! We have easy access to public transportation and are close enough to downtown and Yale that I typically ride my bike over there when I'm headed to the area. If you have a car, it's about 5-10 mins to downtown/Yale and we have easy access to I95/91. There are three other roommates you'd maybe bump into at some point, but only one of them ever needs to come downstairs other than laundry. I've moved some furniture around since AirBnB took the photos that are up so the bed is now a king instead of a queen, and some of the shelving has changed. It is also important to note that a 55 lb pit bull lives here. He is the cutest, cuddliest dog you will ever meet but if you are allergic to dogs this may not be the best fit for you. He is not allowed downstairs when guests are here unless you specifically want him to be, but he is allowed in that space otherwise so we can not assure a dog hair free zone. Guest Access You'll have access to all of the common areas in the house including the kitchen, dining room, and deck. You'll have access to the washer/dryer as well. Interaction with Guests New friends are awesome so we're happy to hang out, go eat or whatever so long as we're not too busy. That said, if you'd rather just pretend we're not here and we mostly ignore each other, that's totally fine too. If you're here on a Tuesday night, we host Taco Tuesday every week at the house unless I am away for work. I cook for about 20ish people and everyone hangs around eating and drinking. You'd be more than welcome to join us, or not, though it's usually not the most restful environment so if you need a silent house to sleep at 10pm we're probably not the best fit on Tuesday nights. Other Things to Note Our standard check in time is after 3pm and check out before 1pm, but these are pretty flexible and we're happy to move them around or hold luggage or whatever so long as it doesn't conflict with other guests. + More","House Rules The big rule is just to be respectful and positive. Also, no smoking cigarettes in the house and no pets. The dog that lives here does not get along with other animals, despite loving people. + More",1 night minimum stay,The Space Accommodates: 4 Bathrooms: 2 Bedrooms: 1 Beds: 2 Property type: House Room type: Private room House Rules,94 Reviews,#neighborhood,Safety Features Smoke Detector Carbon Monoxide Detector First Aid Kit Fire Extinguisher,Prices Extra people: $15 / night after 2 guests Weekly discount: 13% Monthly discount: 0%,69,Matt,Matt,https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1121232#neighborhood,New Haven,#host-profile,"New Haven, CT, United States",https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1121232#host-profile,Private room,4 Guests,"New Haven, CT, United States",https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1121232,CT,New Haven525,2 Beds,Member since August 2015,"Amenities Kitchen Kitchen Space where guests can cook their own meals Internet TV Essentials Essentials Towels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper + More","Luxury 2Beds Pvt Rm in 3k+sf Unit of 7k+sf Villa in upscale neighborhood with swimming pool access, central location to Hartford Insurance Capital, Hospitals, ESPN, NBC and other professions.

Dwight is an urban area and we're on the ambulance route so if you're looking for something super quiet, you're better off checking out a place in East Rock. However, if you're used to big cities, you'll find Dwight comparatively tranquil. There are a few bars and restaurants down the street, though our particular block is mainly residential. Our place is on the first floor of the building, and is a two-bedroom apartment. The room we're renting out doubles as guestroom and office, and the bed is a pull-out sofa-bed which is ideal for one person but can fit two (the bed measures 46 x 80 inches). The guestroom contains a number of bookshelves, a desk and chair, as well as a small built-in closet which guests are free to use. It's a bright room and super sunny in the mornings though we have dark curtains for those who prefer to sleep in. The apartment has a central heating system and we have smaller electric heaters as well. There is only one bathroom in the apartment, so we'll have to share. You're also welcome to use the kitchen and our washing machine if you need to do laundry. We *do not* provide breakfast. On-street parking is usually plentiful, though there are also paid parking lots close by. We're three blocks away from the Yale shuttle stop on York/Chapel, and the bus-stop for CTTransit route F is just outside our door. There's a large Stop & Shop about a 5-10 mins' walk from our place, as well as a number of smaller grocery stores, a liquor store, a Dunkin Donuts, our very own neighbourhood comic book store (!), and a 24-hour Walgreens all within a block or two. + More","House Rules Most of these aren't exactly house rules, but we do ask that you note the following BEFORE requesting a booking: - Please send us a message telling us a little bit about yourself and why you're in town. - We *do not* provide breakfast.

The Neighborhood Stonington, CT was listed in Yankee Magazine's Top-10 Coastal Towns in 2015. The Borough is a unique fishing village situated on a small peninsula with public access to the shoreline throughout. With its history extending back to pre-Revolutionary times, the houses and architecture here span almost three centuries. Main St. is a charming place to stroll, window shop on Water St., enjoy great restaurants, visit the Point with its vistas of the Harbor, Fisher's Island, Watch Hill, Mystic Seaport and Groton in 270 degree views. Visit the beach or walk out on the old stone pier, take a sailing lesson at NESS, or pull in to Dodson's Boatyard on your own boat. The Lighthouse Museum is down the street and offers walking tours of the historical village. The area is chock full of antiquing, thrift shops, farmer's markets, lobster and seafood shacks, and don't miss the Velvet Mill which contains a whole variety of craft artisans, a brewery, a cheese shop, a bakery, galleries and shops in an old brick textile factory on the village outskirts. Mystic Seaport and Village, Pequot Museum, Mystic Aquarium and the vibrant town of Westerly, RI are all within a few miles of Stonington. And in the Autumn, leaf peepers make a pilgrimage to this lovely area to take in the stunning New England Fall foliage display. The stone walls themselves are numerous and mysterious, and seem to give this magical place its true name. Stunning beaches of Rhode Island are within a 20-minute drive, for swimming, surfing and sunbathing. Or simply walk 2 minutes to DuBois Beach on the Point. Boating seems to be the favorite sport hereabouts and there are plenty of coves, harbors and miles of shoreline to explore. Barn Island is a wildlife sanctuary full of trails for hiking, boating, hunting and fishing. Getting Around On and off-street parking are available. There is virtually no public transit, so walking, biking, boating and driving are the main modes of transportation in the Borough and its surroundings. Other Things to Note Stuart and I are almost always at home or nearby, and are ready to be of assistance to guests. + More",House Rules Please keep the peace between the hours of 10 pm and 7 am.

The dogs do not go into the basement, so you will have little--if any--interaction with them, but they are part of the family and do make dog noises so light sleepers please take note!

The rooms are large with plenty of closet, drawer, and other storage space. This suite is within a large home where the host lives. There is ample off-street parking and a garage bay for snowy day parking. The home is set within a beautiful wooded 6+ acre lot with a southwest mountain view. A unique feature is the beautiful koi pond and outdoor seating area (back lawn) as well as a large secure front lawn and paved area for sports and play.

Interaction with Guests The private entrance enables guests to come and go with or without interaction depending on their inclination. I take a concierge approach to hosting. I am very interested in people and enjoy having guests. My priority is to ensure guests feel welcome, comfortable, and well served. I can suggest local activities and sights based on your interests. Many items area are available for loan to support your visit so please don't hesitate to ask for assistance and advice with anything that can make your stay more enjoyable and convenient. While I greatly enjoy meeting people, listening, and engaging in conversation, if your preference is to have limited contact I respect that. Just let me know when you are available for communications needed for me to be a good host. I greet you upon arrival and am present at night and parts of the day. Please communicate house guidelines to others whom we have agreed will be staying here. The Neighborhood My neighborhood has mountain/sunset views and large wooded lots with lots of wildlife and birds. While secluded, it is five miles to Bradley Airport and many international corporations in my town and neighboring industrial towns of Windsor Locks and Windsor. You can walk or ride a bike to the Farmington Valley Greenway, part of the national Rails to Trails system. A public golf course is also just down the road. Within a 5-10 minute drive are many stores such as Starbucks, CVS pharmacy, Stop & Shop supermarket, and health food stores/deli's. A large variety of excellent restaurants are also a short drive away. Getting Around Bradley Airport is five miles away. Depending on flight times and my schedule, I can give you a ride to and from the airport. The Amtrak station is a few miles away - best way to get to New York City. There is also an express bus to Hartford which leaves from the same location. Express buses to NYC and Boston leave from Hartford (a 20 minute drive) frequently. Metro North to NYC departs every hour from New Haven, an hour's drive from my home. Boston is a 1 1/2 hour drive, all highways. For most local travel you will need your own automobile transportation.

Share my bathroom, kitchen and living room-more of a typical B & B experience than my larger listing","Description The Space Except for your guest room, my home interior is painted bold, vibrant colors. There is a medium size dorm fridge in your room. Though my cat sleeps upstairs with me, she is allowed in every room except the guest rooms. Guest Access The main floor kitchen, bathroom and living room are open for guest use. My personal living space is on the upper level and is NOT open for guest access. I don't have cable TV but I do have an extensive video library for use in the living room. Interaction with Guests I only accept bookings on nights that I can be home from work so I can really make myself accessible to my guests. I'll provide a few treats in your room and we can discuss breakfast preferences--I make great omelets and muffins! **Please let me know at the time of your booking what food allergies or sensitivities you have so I can begin snack and meal planning. The Neighborhood This is an old neighborhood. The homes are charming and diverse early 20th century construction and no two homes look alike. Please note, if you prefer contemporary developments this won't be to your taste. The neighborhood and residents are quirky and genuine. My house only has on street parking. There's plenty of room, as I have a long frontage, but it isn't to everyone's taste. My home was built in 1905. The back yard has a small body of water teeming with peep frogs and a pair of ducks each spring. The side yard is a meadow of wild flowers. There's a Starbuck's, Dunkin Donuts, Dairy Queen, McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Five Guys, Little Caesar's and 99 Restaurant all within three miles. There's a great northern Italian restaurant, and equally fantastic Indian restaurant within walking distance as well as a good Irish pub and Vietnamese (the Pho is delicious) restaurant about a mile away. Mohegan Sun hosts numerous restaurants and shopping and is just 10 minutes away. Getting Around You'll need your own vehicle because the bus service here is poor. Taxis are available for casino and other local jaunts. There are many great destinations in Connecticut! Mohegan Sun is 10 minutes away; Foxwoods is about 15 minutes. In New London, the Garde Arts Center, Connecticut College, The Coast Guard Academy and Lyman Allyn Museum are about 15 minutes away. It's only half an hour to Mystic (Seaport and Aquarium); an hour to New Haven (Toad's Place, Yale, craft brewery, entertainment and night life); 30 minutes to Hartford (Trinity College, City Steam craft brewery, entertainment at XL Center and night life); 20 minutes to Willimantic (Eastern Connecticut State University, Willimantic Brewery (Willibrew craft brewery); 40 minutes to Storrs (UConn). Explore the CT Wine Trail or hike at Devil's Hopyard or Lantern Hill. In Essex, 40 minutes away, visit the CT River Museum, charming shops and the Griswold Inn, (one of the oldest bars in the country) where The Jovial Crew performs sea chanteys and other maritime music every Monday from 8 to 11 p.m. It's a unique form of entertainment that draws visitors from around the world. Recently the Griswold Inn appeared on the Huffington Post's list: The ""10 Most Historic Restaurants and Inns in the World"", with a nod to The Jovial Crew! Visit Gillette's Castle or catch a great show at The Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam. You'll be well located for the next leg of your vacation continuing on to Boston, Providence, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont or any place else that beckons. Other Things to Note The most important thing to know is that I have a very friendly cat who will want to befriend you. I don't allow her in guest rooms but she has free access to every other room in the house so you will probably be loved up. ;) My house has only on street parking so please park on the same side of the street as the house so my neighbors won't be upset.

Enjoy the view of the private, large, park-like backyard, surrounded by woods from your bedroom window. You may see deer grazing or wild turkeys in the early morning or at sundown.","Description The Space Welcome budget-minded travelers, outdoor enthusiasts, quiet, considerate, friendly folks! PLEASE, KINDLY TAKE A MOMENT TO READ THIS DESCRIPTION. IT SHOULD ANSWER MANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS... Offering a lovely, cozy, single-dwelling HOUSE that is designed like an old farm house with the kitchen as the center of the house. It is in a quiet neighborhood. The bedroom is the sun porch of the house. It has windows on 2 sides that look out on a private backyard surrounded by trees. There is partition that closes off the sleeping area so you have privacy. The closet is outside the sleeping area. You enter the bedroom area through the kitchen and down one step. The bathroom is off the kitchen in a sitting room. NOTE: There are 5 indoor cats, all friendly and quiet except at feeding time, and a small 20 pound dog who is very friendly. If you have allergies to pets, this is not a good place to stay. But if you love pets, you will love these 4-legged characters. BEDROOM: Comfy, full size, double bed, typically for single individuals due to space and size of bed. However, two can sleep well, depending on your size and needs, I accept $30 add'l cost per person per night. Small flat screen TV in room where you can play DVDs. WiFi is available for your laptop. This room was originally a sun porch, as mentioned above, converted to a bedroom for guests so it is bright and cheerful with windows on 2 walls facing the side and back of the house. When you look out of the windows, it feels like you're looking out of a tree house because you are one story above the yard. In order to maintain a way to get to the deck and maintain your privacy, there is a partition of bi-fold doors (which can be seen in one of the photos). The sleeping area on one side of the partition is almost 8 ft deep x 10 ft wide, with a closet outside the sleep area. ADDITIONAL GUESTS: I can accept a 3rd person who can use the queen-sized sofa bed in the living room. Not much privacy but it's great for a child, especially if s/he likes a cat to curl up with. Because it is a shared bathroom, when there is more than one guest, short stays are best. The add'l guest fee is $30/pp. BATHROOM: SHARED WITH HOST (and the occasional add'l guest(s). No private bathroom facilities are available. Shelf available for personal toiletries. FRESH TOWELS/LINENS PROVIDED. Guests who stay for more than 1 night will use same bed linens. Stays that exceed a week will have their linens laundered. **Guest(s) may use the shampoo, shower wash and soap. **SORRY, no LAUNDRY facilities are available for short-term stays (less than 7 days). KINDLY READ/HONOR THE ""HOUSE RULES"" & ""HOUSE MANUAL"". Just some basic, simple requests are stated. Airbnb provides these details also on the confirmed ITINERARY sent to each guest. Please take the time to read it thoroughly, I cannot take responsibility for you in that realm. EAT-IN KITCHEN has all the amenities  refrigerator, stove/oven, extra cabinet space, shelf in fridge, toaster oven, coffeemaker, great selection of utensils, microwave, dishwasher. Host offers some teas, and coffee. If you have a preference, bring your own preferred morning beverage and use the coffeemaker! THE DRIVEWAY is a slope downward below street level. It, at first may feel a bit daunting, but once you've driven it, you'll see that it isn't bad at all. I've lived here for 5 years and don't even think about it. Because the house is on a curvy road, there is a blind spot on one side of the driveway. Once I tell you the ""secret"" of how to make sure there is no oncoming traffic from that side when you exit the driveway, you will find getting out of the driveway easy. OTHER CONVENIENCES: High speed internet available. Sorry, no computer available. Living room has a 32"" flat-panel TV. If you want to bring/rent DVDs to watch, that's fine with me. If you want to use the living room TV instead of in the bedroom, please check with me to be sure I have nothing scheduled for that time frame. ADD'L PETS? Sorry, cannot accept add'l guest pets -- although I might consider, if pet is small and can be kept in the room. There would be an add'l fee and pet deposit.

Guests may also use the kitchen, TV (in the parlor), garden, and hammock.","Description The Space Clover Nook is set next to a ravine complete with a creek that can become a torrent in the spring. It is a two-family house with a door between the kitchens. This bedroom is small and most suitable for kids, the budget conscious, and small people--the beds are short. It does not have air conditioning, but it does have a window fan. It's on the driveway, which we share with the house next door, so it can be noisy during the daytime. The room shares a bathroom with the larger bedroom down the hall. It's suitable for a maximum of two people. I usually cannot accommodate last-minute bookings. Guest Access Guests are welcome to use the kitchen for simple cooking or just as a place to hang out. The house has wireless Internet. I don't have much in the way of TV (very basic cable), but I do have Netflix. There is only one TV, which is in the parlor. When the weather is good, guests are welcome to use the garden and the back area. I hesitate to call it a patio because it is where I pot plants, but it is where we grill and build fires. We have a battered fire pit and plenty of wood. Interaction with Guests I will be in the house during your stay. I work at home, so if you need me for anything, you will find me in my office--or the garden. The Neighborhood This is an ethnically and culturally mixed neighborhood, and it is mixed zoning. Clover Nook once housed a beauty parlor; we found two of those old-fashioned hair dryers with the huge hoods in the basement. Toward the end of the street stands a collection of very small houses that were probably built to house mill employees. At the very end is the house where the songwriter Henry Clay Work was born. Among his best-known tunes are ""Marching Through Georgia"" and ""My Grandfather's Clock."" There is a statue of Work on Middletown's South Green, which is a few blocks from the house. Downtown Restaurants (listed in order of distance, farthest away first) Tibetan Kitchen Located at 574 Main Street, Tibetan Kitchen is an unassuming little place with great food. I have no idea whether it is authentic, but it's certainly delicious. There is something for everyone here: curries, soups, dumplings, and more and lots of vegan and vegetarian options. BYOB (there is a corking fee). Bring patienceservice can be slow and the place can get very busy, but the wait is well worth it. Also bring cashno checks or credit cards are accepted. Closed Sundays. Iguanas Ranas Taquer_a Iguanas Ranas, 484 Main Street, is a family business that started small and keeps growing. I like everything I've had there but adore the fish tacos. The place gets noisy at night, so we usually go for lunch and try to get a table in the window. Full bar. Closed Sundays. Caf 56 Caf 56, at 102 Court Street, is one of our favorite Middletown restaurants. Open for breakfast and lunch, it features foods and culinary traditions from different countries and ethnicities. From the website: The goal at Caf 56 is to provide the customers with the experience of the different tastes from around the world."" The chef and owner is Sabrina Cortes, who is from Guatemala City. She also serves, buses tables, chats with everyone, and generally sees to everything. Ed Thereault bakes scones, croissants (real ones), country buttermilk biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and a variety of coffee cakes and muffins every morning. He also creates delicious desserts; some of his specialties include the Caf 56 red velveteen cake with caramel buttercream icing and a coconut lime cake. Closed Sundays. Fiore II Restaurant This Italian restaurant, at 332 Main Street, is very pretty inside and out. All the food looks wonderful, but I always end up ordering scampi and trying to talk someone into sharing a bowl of lobster bisque. Beer and wine are available. I don't know whether other alcohol is served, but I'll find out and revise this. Closed Mondays. Amici Italian Grill Amici's, 280 Main Street, specializes in northern Italian cooking. It has a full bar and is often crowded, especially on weekend nights. Open every day for lunch and dinner. Getting Around Middletown does have a bus system, and I have a schedule, but most people drive, walk, or bike. Parking is available in the driveway or on the street. Other Things to Note When a guest arrived recently, she asked if we could recommend a good massage therapist. We said sure--ours. Lugging her table, Joan made a house call. Everyone was pleased, and Joan decided she would be happy to do it again. If anyone who books at Clover Nook would like to arrange for a massage, I will pass along Joan's number after the booking, and Joan and the guest can make whatever arrangement they like.

Our house is a block away from Edgewood park and Westville offers several breakfast locations, dining, and modest entertainment.

Gales Ferry/Ledyard is less well known but has a lot to offer- a historic village on the Thames River, an annual Regatta with Harvard and Yale, a county fair, weekly fireworks displays in the summer, wine vineyards, and a lovely little orchard where you can pick your own berries, apples, etc right up the street. Just 15 minutes away you can hop on the Amtrak or take a ferry to Block Island. An hour and a half from Boston by train, 2 1/2 hours to New York City - this is the perfect place for a relaxing weekend or as a stop between cities. Interaction with Guests My mom Betty will be hosting you. She is a firecracker, full of information about the local area and will give you as much space as you need. I am helping with the communication since she is not too tech-savvy. We have lived in the area a long time and know all the hidden gems! My sister Jen lives locally and is very connected to the local farm scene. She can point you in the right direction or arrange a tour if you are interested.

If it's bothersome I can move it. IMPORTANT NOTE PLEASE READ: There has been misunderstandings w/cleanliness-- I do clean the older upstairs bathroom regularly. I have health issues with dust/dirt. The reason why tub/floor/tiles look stained/dirt is because its design, older, faded & scratched. I've tried cleaning for hours with the most *powerful* chemicals, cannot remove & cannot afford more renovation than I already do. ***If you have an issue with appearance, please use the newer downstairs bathroom. Thank you! Many questions you have, parking, room, etc is usually in this description listing. You will receive additional guide information upon booking where items are located. CANCELLATION POLICY: Please read Airbnb's policy carefully. Airbnb does not refund fees & charges host's pay when you cancel. I've been generous/flexible to allow changes day prior, (when other hosts need 1 week), even when I lose out. However, it's been *really* tough with my busy schedule, when waiting for guests (that are sometimes 3-4+ hours late), taking much time coordinating, questions, preparing, checking in, touring & cleaning. - So guests will no longer receive full refund (minus fees) if you cancel/change after booking starts.*** There are only some exceptions. If guests cancel/change last minute, I can't easily schedule another guest last minute, and guests normally do not book the day of, so I lose those days & weekend. CANCELLATION PAYMENT: - Airbnb automatically gives full refund (minus fees), according to policy before booking starts. - If you request after booking, they refund partial according to cancellation policy. - I am not required submit a request to Airbnb & for additional refunds, but if I do **Airbnb needs time & makes the final decision on what to refund to you.** - Please be honest why you're canceling, if you find something that better fits your location, schedule, preferences, etc, please state it's your decision. Or else Airbnb team will contact hosts to try to dispute. Guest Access - Generally I don't feel comfortable allowing check-ins without my presence. Upon booking, you will receive instructions on how to lock/unlock door. CHECK IN / CHECK OUT / ARRIVAL Please ask my availability to check you in. Normally weekdays after 6pm and weekends anytime I'm around. - Please know, homes are *not* hotels with full time staff to check you in anytime, and I often delay/reschedule/cancel my own plans to check in guests, so please respect my time like I do for guests. - I'd appreciate a 1 hour maximum time slot in case you're delayed, but please arrive the time you say you will. - Guest can have access to all common areas, such as kitchen (to prep your own food/groceries), shared bathrooms (1 with tub or 1 with walk in stone shower), dining room, yard, deck, & upstairs living room, and downstairs lounge area.

Interaction with Guests Currently, my schedule is unfortunately hectic, time & budget is small, so my interaction with guests may be minimal. I'd be happy to suggest awesome food & recreation nearby you can go to. The Neighborhood Town next to Orange & Minutes from downtown New Haven, and downtown Milford, etc. Not too far from NYC (1.5 hr train ride). Minutes from Yale (New Haven, and West Campus in Orange), VA hospital, New Haven University (UNH), and Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) This is not downtown, but nice woodsy area. Please be prepared for your own transportation. Guests had no problem using Taxi, Uber, Bus or Bike. Plenty of shopping, recreation & nightlife near by, but transportation needed. A Deli & coffee shop is walkable distance. My neighborhood is very nice and pleasant, very quiet, sometimes dead quiet. It's at a dead end. My neighbors are nice. They have families. I'm probably one of few who aren't living with a family. It's nice living away from city noise, but close enough to events, happenings. Though CT looks vast in lands, there are a lot of variety of things to do or experience. It's also a photographer's dream. Getting Around Minutes from Milford and New Haven train station. Walkable distance to bus line (5-10min) that leads to downtown. Bikeable distance to downtown. 10 minutes by car/taxi/uber without traffic & 20-30minutes downtown or UNH by bus. ::PARKING - FREE & EASY:: - Park perpendicular (instead of parallel) facing my house (so 3 cars fit) - Diagonal in front of LEFT neighbors at a slight diagonal, (so 2 cars fit, without blocking either driveways) - Or park off to the side parallel on side near the bushes (away from blocking the mail boxes). For winter/snow, we can discuss arranging our cars to be out of the way from the snow plows. Guests are generally responsible for their own transportation, but sometimes if I'm in the same area & heading home at the same time, as drop off (e.g. downtown New Haven train/station), I can pick you up. Other Things to Note If necessary, will ask for ID verification and video chat before booking, especially with longer stays or you don't have many reviews, I may ask for appropriate documents: e.g. ID, . Credit Report, Utilities/Rental History, etc + More","House Rules Please be clean, kind, courteous, respectful. - Wear warm clothes during cold weather.

I'll show how to turn it down. Please be kind. If this is an issue, please try another location, but this area expensive, so trying to help you out :) - Please turn off all lights if not in use. - If there is a draft please let me know.. it's a double pain window so if you open or touch the lock & not close properly there is a large gap & cause large draft.

Guest Access You have privacy in your room and have full access to the shared bathroom and large eat-in kitchen. Interaction with Guests We are two friends in our 30's, both working professionals. We are social but if you prefer not to socialize, that's fine too. You have as much privacy as you like, and we are here to help as needed. We can provide recommendations for orientation to New Haven including where to go for all things Yale, transport, shopping, entertainment, and dining. As needed, we can also provide recommendations and orientation for the rest of Connecticut and travel to New York City. Let us know! The Neighborhood We're right in the heart of historic Wooster Square! It's a beautiful, safe, charming neighborhood with lots to offer and is just a short walk from Yale and the downtown commercial district. Food: For restaurants, the famed Pepe's and Sally's pizza restaurants are known as having some of the best pizza in America, and there're also plenty of other fine and inexpensive italian restaurants in the neighborhood. On Saturdays, enjoy the popular Wooster Square farmer's market just 50 yards from the doorstep where vendors sell everything from produce to crepes, pastry, grilled cheese and smoothies. There's also a great liquor store right on the corner. For groceries, there're both inexpensive and gourmet grocery stores within a 3-5 blocks. Things to do: Wooster Square Park is also one block away - a large, wide open, beautiful park filled with cherry, maple, oak, and sycamore. If you want night clubs, bars, and downtown shopping, it's also just 5 blocks away by the downtown Yale campus. This is a prime location with easy access to everything you'd need. And if you have any questions, just ask! Getting Around If you want to get to different parts of the sprawling Yale campus or around town, hop on the free shuttle or walk to the central Yale campus just 5 blocks away. Also, there's Uber in New Haven, and there's also Zipcar spots near here. Hertz has a rental location a few blocks away, and there's also a place to rent bicycles a few blocks away. If you're driving, there's quick and easy access to and from I-95 and I-91 (both North & South) within a couple minutes. The train station is also close enough to walk to. When I go to New York City, I usually walk so I don't have to pay for parking at the garage, and it only takes about 10 minutes to walk there. From there, you can take a train up to Hartford or up and down the coast. It takes about 2 hours and costs about $16-22 each way to go to New York City from New Haven's Union station. Other Things to Note Breakfast is self-service and includes items we have on hand such as oatmeal, granola, plain yogurt, maple-syrup or honey, fruit, coffee, or tea. Please be aware the room has a full-privacy doorway curtain as the threshold is not suited for hung, wooden doors. The room is at the far end of the apartment away from common areas and has plenty of privacy.

Other Things to Note This house is in the process of having minor cosmetic updates so there are a few spots where there is peeling paint, older wallpaper or the paper wallpaper backing on the walls. The downstairs is in fine shape. Upstairs one bedroom is not suitable for guests at this point, leaving a fully renovated guest bedroom and a master bedroom for guest use. This house also has a resident feline, who is incredibly sweet and affectionate. Conditions of your stay mean feeding her and giving her water daily, not letting her outside (she doesn't generally try to escape) and perhaps refreshing the litter box. If you do not want litter duty and plan to stay more than a week I will send my brother-in-law over once to change it.

Great wall-to-wall ocean view with huge windows for an ocean breeze. Access to livingroom, kitchen, balcony and washer/dryer. 12 min from Yale & 5 minutes from I-95 or Metro North train.","Description The Space This is a two-bedroom apartment and I am the only occupant. This is a secure, 8-story apartment building overlooking Long Island Sound less than 100 meters from the beach. The building entrance requires a key that you will have. Parking is free and in a private lot next to the building. There are many nearby restaurants from Italian to Turkish - you name it. Details below. Your room has: A beautiful, wall-to-wall view of Long Island Sound from the 5th floor, A private bathroom with double sink and tub-shower combination, A queen-size bed. High, glass table with two stools by the window, Bureau and closet, Personal AC/heat, Access to livingroom, balcony, fully equipped kitchen & washer/dryer in the apartment, Small, hotel-size refrigerator for convenience in addition to plenty of shared space in the main fridge. Note: I have three very sweet cats. They are not allowed in your bedroom and the apartment has two air-cleaners, but if you have a strong allergy to cats, this may not be for you. Guest Access Guests are welcome to use the washer-dryer, anything found in the fully-equipped kitchen, the living room, balcony, and the high-speed WiFi and basic cable. Kitchen equipment includes a cappuccino and espresso maker, regular drip coffee maker and French press coffee maker, crock-pot, rice-cooker, bread-maker, toaster oven, microwave, electric stove and oven. Interaction with Guests I enjoy talking with guests but interaction is generally just passing in the kitchen and I have no expectations. The Neighborhood The beach, walkable for miles, is less than 100 yards (meters) from the front door. Within a mile, the beach goes from fairly urban to an isolated jetty used mostly for fishing, and sandy beach all the way. You can go fishing, see crabs, collect shells, and watch gorgeous sunrises and sunsets. The West Haven boardwalk, just above the beach, allows for running, walking and biking on a well-maintained, non-commercial, paved trail. There are concerts and dances in one of the parks on the Boardwalk during the summer. Other shore parks nearby within 10 minutes include Silver Sands State Park, a bird sanctuary and another lovely nature preserve with a boardwalk that runs through a beautiful salt marsh along the shore. The immediate neighborhood has restaurants of all types: Italian, Mexican, Peruvian, West Indian, Japanese, Turkish and more. There is seafood, of course, up and down the shore including Stowe's, a great place that you can see from your window. Please note that this is a highly diverse, urban neighborhood. Getting Around Uber is active in the area. Buses: The last bus M-F from downtown New Haven to me is 11:45 PM. Saturday it's 9:45 PM and Sunday 7:30 PM. You can get full bus (EMAIL HIDDEN) (if the URL doesn't show here, it's the abbreviation for our State followed by transit and then the most common url ending. That site has a nice app that lets you put in your start address and destination and date and time and it tells you how to get there by public transportation. There's also Metro-North - see below. Trains: There is a new Metro-North train station 5 minutes away by car (1.7 miles). Union Station in New Haven is the easiest train stop from which to get a bus to me. Across the street from the front of the station, catch a J7 or J5 West Haven bus. The bus takes about 20 min. Tell the driver you want to go to the corner of Washington Street and Capt. Thomas Blvd. in West Haven. Other Things to Note What's Nearby: Here's a guide to beach walks, parks, restaurants, night life, grocery stores and farmers' markets! Beach Walks: South beach-walk (away from New Haven) Go to the beach and turn right on the Boardwalk. This is a nice, urban beachwalk with little parks along the way. At the end of the Boardwalk, after a half mile or a mile is Veterans Walk, with benches right on the water and rocks to sit on, too. A larger park just before this one has weekend concerts one or two evenings a week all summer. Along the way on the right is Jimmies Restaurant, which you can also get to from the beach itself or driving on Capt. Thomas Blvd. Jimmies is very old and famous and that, apparently, is the only reason it's still in business. The food reviews are pretty horrible, unless you want nothing but expensive fried clams and hot dogs. It's a nice place to get a drink on the water, though. The view is great. Better seafood is in the other direction, at Stowe's. Veterans Walk is the end of the Boardwalk, but not your beachwalk! A wide, fine-sand beach extends from there and you can walk it for another couple of miles, either on the sand or on a sidewalk. There is beach volley-ball (town-organized league play) on certain nights and weekends in the summer. North Beach-walk: (towards New Haven) Coming from the apartment, cross the parking lot to the beach and turn left on the Boardwalk instead of right for a very different beachwalk. The Boardwalk quickly turns into sidewalk, and I recommend the beach itself instead of the sidewalk. Less than a block away is Stowe's Seafood - very good food at a very reasonable price, and further on is Chic's Restaurant, a popular fried-seafood place with more of a hang-out atmosphere. A fun clam-shack. Keep going and watch this urban beach turn into a beautiful, isolated jetty going far out into the harbor where there are no people except a few serious fishermen and women. Just beautiful. This is actually a protected bird-sanctuary, so don't venture far into the dunes. Milford: Driving a bit south into the next town, you can find a wildlife sanctuary with a boardwalk going right through a beautiful salt marsh along the shore. This is Silver Sands State Park. Local Restaurants: I'm new in the neighborhood, so this is a work in progress. There is a very wide variety of restaurants! Your favorite review site, like Urban Spoon, Trip Advisor, or Foursquare will have a more complete list than I could possibly provide, but here are a few suggestions: Pizza Why a category for Pizza? Because New Haven has a few of the most famous pizza restaurants in the U.S. Pepe's and Sally's are at 157 and 237 Wooster Street, respectively, in New Haven, and Modern is at 874 State Street. Sally's has recently fallen in ratings, but you have to try at least Pepe's and Modern  you just do. Fast Food: There's a Subway across the street in the little strip mall. Vegie/Vegan: New Haven has tons, and in West Haven, there's Georgie's Diner (URL HIDDEN) which has vegan and gluten-free meals as well as regular diner classics. More Restaurants: Caseus, 93 Whitney Ave, New Haven. Outstanding, reasonably priced and unique. This is a cheese shop with a restaurant specializing in cheese dishes. Extremely good reviews - #1 in New Haven of all Restaurant types on Trip Advisor. Abate, next door to Pepe's Pizza on Wooster Street in New Haven, gets high marks for general Italian cuisine. There is also a pretty good Italian restaurant right across the street from my building. Seafood: There are three seafood places right in the neighborhood, and the best one, Stowe's, is right across the street! There's also a good ice cream parlor just a block away. There is also very fresh seafood to be found at all the Farmers' Markets. See below. Immediate Neighborhood: Take a walk up Campbell Ave and you find everything! Italian, Indian, Puruvian, Turkish, you name it! There are even a few $2 breakfast places! Clubs/Bars There's a good list of New Haven hot spots at the Info New Haven website under ""Nightlife."" It's a 25 min. drive, but a unique experience is Captain's Cove Seaport in Bridgeport. This is a family destination during the day and a hot, local rock scene at night with a rare, mixed-ages crowd (that means plenty of middle-aged folk along with the younguns). It has indoors and outdoors bars and dance-floors, all on the harbor, and on a boat! Check the online schedule for activities, bands and line-dancing nights! Theater, Museums There's a big list on the Info New Haven website under ""Culture-Listing."" The Yale Peabody Natural History Museum is free on Thursdays from 2-5 PM. The Yale art museum is free all the time! Local Grocery Shopping & Farmers' Markets: A block away is a little strip mall with a package store and two, dollar-type stores. The first one is like the old General Store. It has a surprising amount of groceries, including a considerable selection of Spanish and Chinese foods, and if you need a pair of jeans, a pressure-cooker, a lawn chair, a USB charger or rachet-straps to hold that mattress on the roof of your car, well, it's got that, too! There's a Stop n' Shop a mile or so away. Go up Campbell to Elm, turn left and keep going. That's also where Georgie's Diner is, with regular diner fare and vegan. Farmers' Markets  Find one on Thursday, Saturday or Sunday. West Haven on the Green (go straight up Campbell) every Thursday and Saturday, 10-2. BEST: In New Haven, the Wooster Square Market is open every Saturday May 4 -December 21, from 9am-1pm. Location: Russo Park, corner of Chapel Street and DePalma Court. Take the F or G bus to Wooster Square. There is also a Farmers' Market at Edgewood Park, corner of Whalley and West Rock Avenues in New Haven May 5  December 22, Sundays, 10:00am  2:00pm. + More","House Rules No smokers. No pets.

We have a furnished (full-size bed, desk) room on the 2nd floor with sunny windows, closet, and your own attic space. You would share a bath with one person.","Description The Space Note: the room that is available is larger than room shown- just wanted to get it listed, will update room pictures soon! It is difficult to describe how big and spacious this house really is - we use it almost like two homes! You would be using the main level has a spacious kitchen and state-of-the-art oven, living room with windows surrounding three sides, a dining room, a sunroom, a large walk-out patio, and much more. This space is far larger than most homes! The basement has an open floor plan, a dining area, living area, full kitchen/bar, and small gym area - all of which you are more than welcome to come down and use as well. You are getting far more space and much more privacy than you would get just about anywhere else, with much more cool stuff, at truly bargain price. Also - laundry is free to use (please set an alarm so you don't leave your laundry in all day) and the back patio and BBQ are wonderful in the summer! Guest Access There are no real limitations on where you can go or what you can use except for one - please do not enter any personal bedrooms. So we welcome you to make yourself at home but respect everyone's privacy. Interaction with Guests We are graduate students at UConn who like having a nice, clean, spacious, and relaxing place to come home to after a long day at the lab. With a house as sunny and spacious as this, the atmosphere is calm and relaxing but still fun (just to be make sure there is no misunderstanding of what 'fun' means, we definitely have moved on from the drama and crazy parties of undergrads). We are Air BNB-ing this summer only because we have just the summer available for this room. Like most graduate students, we are busy; for that reason, graduate school (especially at UConn) can be fairly isolating. After a long day, sometimes we'll just watch a movie and have a drink, but it is nice to have pleasant people to do it with if you choose. We don't have parties at home (it is really a home, not a party house), but like to have smaller gatherings for a BBQ. We like to get together on occasion with another house of graduate students that live close by to have dinner, go out to dinner in Willimantic, or do something active outdoors. A lot of it depends on what you like to do - some roommates have just loved to cook gourmet meals on the awesome oven and eat them on our picnic or patio tables. We prefer to study/work outside the house, but it is quiet enough to study peacefully here during the day if you want. The Neighborhood The Historic Hill District is a great part of town close to restaurants and other attractions. Willimantic is the largest town within 15 minutes of UConn and has cafes, cool stores (chocolate store, a cupcake store), the Willimantic Brew House, and more! Unlike Storrs, there are also local events (3rd Thursday, Boom Box Parade) as well. Also, unlike most towns in the area, if you don't have a car, you can walk downtown or to the bus stop (which goes to the UConn campus) from the house! We are a VERY short walk to the ECSU campus! The neighborhood is also very nice - it may be the nicest in town. We are surrounded by professionals and families. We have never had issues with the neighbors and they have always been friendly and helpful to boot. Getting Around Very walkable compared to most of the towns in this region - you can walk downtown if you'd like. It is a short walk to the bus stop (less than 10 minutes). See the Windham Region Transit District schedule here: (website hidden)_Schedule.pdf Other Things to Note We are looking for standard, common sense things: someone who is friendly, calm, professional, clean, communicative, and responsible. We have had good luck finding this type of person in the past so you can expect the same! + More","House Rules Just one: respect the home and the people in it!
