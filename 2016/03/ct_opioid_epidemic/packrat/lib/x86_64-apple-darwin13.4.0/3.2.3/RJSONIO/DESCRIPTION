Version: 1.3-0
Title: Serialize R objects to JSON, JavaScript Object Notation
Description: This is a package that allows conversion to and from data
    in Javascript object notation (JSON) format. This allows R objects
    to be inserted into Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript code and
    allows R programmers to read and convert JSON content to R objects.
    This is an alternative to rjson package. Originally, that was too
    slow for converting large R objects to JSON and was not extensible.
    rjson's performance is now similar to this package, and perhaps
    slightly faster in some cases. This package uses methods and is
    readily extensible by defining methods for different classes,
    vectorized operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for
    deserializing JSON objects to R. The two packages intentionally
    share the same basic interface. This package (RJSONIO) has many
    additional options to allow customizing the generation and
    processing of JSON content. This package uses libjson rather than
    implementing yet another JSON parser. The aim is to support other
    general projects by building on their work, providing feedback and
    benefit from their ongoing development.
Note: See http://www.json.org/JSON_checker/test.zip for tests. We now
    use code from the libjson project (http://libjson.sourceforge.net).
