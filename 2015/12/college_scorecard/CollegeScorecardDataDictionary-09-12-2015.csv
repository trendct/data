It is calculated from values in the IPEDS Institutional Characteristics and Student Financial Aid components. Separate metrics are calculated for academic-year institutions and program-year institutions. For academic-year institutions, average cost of attendance represents an average of all programs and includes only undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), average cost of attendance represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution for the length of the full program (see LProgram), regardless of program length, and it includes undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year.

"Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion/6 years) for black students",,completion,completion_rate_4yr_150_black_pre2010,C150_4_BLACKNH,float,, ,,,IPEDS,"The proportion of Black non-Hispanic full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate at the institution within 150 percent of normal time, calculated from the IPEDS Graduation Rates component. Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. This metric is calculated as the number of undergraduates who completed a degree or certificate divided by the number of undergraduates in the corresponding completion rate cohort. For bachelor’s degree-seeking undergraduates, 150 percent of normal time is 6 years, and for associate’s degree-seeking undergraduates it is 3 years. For certificate-seeking undergraduates, the normal time period varies (for example, 9 months for a certificate with a normal completion time of 6 months). Race/ethnicity categories for completion rates have varied over time. Prior to the 2008–09 academic year, the categories were White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, Nonresident Alien, and Unknown. Starting in the 2011–12 academic year, the categories were White, Black/African American, Hispanic, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races, Nonresident Alien, and Unknown. In the 2008–09, 2009–10, and 2010–11 academic years, institutions could use either set of categories. Additional information on changes to race/ethnicity categories is available at http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/reic/resource.asp, and additional information on current categories is available at http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/reic/definitions.asp. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent.
